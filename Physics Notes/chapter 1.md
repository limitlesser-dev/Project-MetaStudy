Here are detailed notes from the provided YouTube video transcript, covering the "Electric Charges and Fields" chapter of Class 12th Physics:

### 1. Introduction to the One-Shot Video and Teaching Approach

- The video is a "one-shot" session covering **Electric Charges and Fields** for Class 12th Physics, including competency-based questions.
- The instructor, Ashu Sir, aims to teach the entire Physics and Chemistry syllabus for Class 12th on the "Ashu Ghai 11th & 12th" YouTube channel.
- **Change in Physics Teaching Approach this year**: Instead of covering concepts, derivations, and questions all in one go (as in previous years), each one-shot will now have two parts.
    - **Part 1**: Focuses on **all concepts, derivations, and definitions**. For Electric Charges and Fields, the instructor has combined his previously recorded two-hour one-shot video.
    - **Part 2**: Focuses heavily on **question-answers**, including Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs), Assertion-Reason questions, and subjective questions. This increased focus on questions is due to the challenging Physics paper in the previous year.
- The questions in the second part are described as "Competency Focused Practice Questions" (SFPQ), many of which are from the "Winner Series".
- Viewers who have already watched the instructor's previous one-shot for Electric Charges and Fields can skip the first two hours (the concepts part) and directly go to the question-answer section.

### 2. Basic Concepts of Electromagnetism

- **Broad Divisions of 12th Class Physics (Part 1)**:
    
    - **Electrostatics**: The study of **charges at rest**.
        - Chapters 1 (Electric Charges and Fields) and 2 fall under Electrostatics.
        - The charge particle **does not flow** in this domain (though it can be moved or transferred).
    - **Electrodynamics**: The study of **charges in motion**.
        - Chapters 3, 4, and subsequent chapters (including magnetism, which is dependent on electrodynamics) fall under Electrodynamics.
        - This involves charge particles "running" through wires, forming current.
- **Electric Charge**:
    
    - **Definition 1**: A property that generates an **electric field** in its surroundings.
    - **Definition 2 (preferred)**: A property that develops in a body due to an **unequal amount of electrons and protons**.
        - **Positive Charge**: Occurs when a body has more protons than electrons (e.g., due to loss of electrons, like Na+, Ca2+, Al3+ ions).
        - **Negative Charge**: Occurs when a body has more electrons than protons (e.g., due to gain of electrons, like Cl-, S2-, O2- ions).
        - The transfer of charge primarily involves **electrons** because protons are tightly bound within the nucleus and their transfer is much more difficult.
    - **SI Unit of Charge**: **Coulomb (C)**.
    - **Charge of an Electron**: **-1.6 x 10⁻¹⁹ C**.
    - **Charge of a Proton**: **+1.6 x 10⁻¹⁹ C** (same magnitude as electron, opposite sign).
    - **Fundamental Law of Electrostatics**:
        - **Like charges (e.g., positive-positive, negative-negative) repel each other**.
        - **Unlike charges (e.g., positive-negative) attract each other**.
        - The exact reason for this attraction/repulsion is not fully understood, hence it's called a fundamental law.
    - **Conductors**: Materials with **free charges** that allow electricity to flow through them.
    - **Insulators**: Materials with **no free charges** that do not allow electricity to flow through them.

### 3. Electrostatic Induction

- **Definition**: A process where **redistribution of charge takes place within a body** when an electrically charged body is brought near it, without direct contact.
- A **charged body can attract an uncharged body**, but it **cannot repel** an uncharged body.
- **Example**: Rubbing a scale on hair and using it to pick up small pieces of paper demonstrates electrostatic induction.
- **Mechanism**: When a positively charged body is brought near an uncharged body, it attracts the free electrons (negative charges) to the side closer to it and repels the positive charges to the farther side. This separation of charges within the uncharged body results in an attractive force.

### 4. Gold Leaf Electroscope

- **Purpose**: A device used to **detect the presence of charge** on a body.
- **Principle**: It works on the principle of **electrostatic induction**.
- **Construction**: Typically consists of a metal rod with a metal knob at the top and two very thin leaves (historically gold, but often aluminum for cost-effectiveness) attached at the bottom. This assembly is enclosed in a transparent container (e.g., glass) to protect the leaves from air currents. Gold is used for leaves due to its high malleability, allowing very thin and light sheets.
- **Working**:
    - When an uncharged body is brought near the electroscope, its leaves hang together.
    - When a charged body (e.g., positively charged) is brought near the metal knob, electrons from the leaves are attracted to the knob by induction, leaving the leaves with a net positive charge. Since both leaves acquire the same type of charge, they repel each other and diverge.
    - If a negatively charged body is brought near, positive charges are attracted to the knob, and negative charges are repelled to the leaves, causing them to diverge.
- **Limitation**: The Gold Leaf Electroscope can **detect the presence of charge**, but it **cannot determine whether the charge is positive or negative**. Both positive and negative charged bodies will cause the leaves to repel.
- The video demonstrates a cheaper version using aluminum foil leaves (Aluminum Leaf Electroscope).

### 5. Basic Properties of Electric Charge

Electric charge follows three fundamental properties:

- **Additivity of Charge**:
    
    - Electric charge is a **scalar quantity**, meaning charges can be added algebraically (like real numbers) to find the total charge of a system.
    - The total charge of a system is the algebraic sum of all individual charges present in the system, considering their signs (positive or negative).
    - **Example**: If a system has charges of -3 C, +2 C, +10 C, and -5 C, the total charge is (-3 + 2 + 10 - 5) C = +4 C.
- **Conservation of Charge**:
    
    - Electric charge can **neither be created nor destroyed**; it can only be **transferred** from one body to another.
    - The **total electric charge of an isolated system remains constant** over time.
- **Quantization of Charge**:
    
    - Electric charge is **not continuous**; it is **discrete** and comes in small, fixed packets.
    - Any charge (Q) on a body is always an **integral multiple of a basic unit of charge**, which is the magnitude of the charge on an electron (e).
    - **Formula**: **Q = ne**.
        - Where 'Q' is the total charge.
        - 'n' is an integer (can be +1, -1, +2, -2, etc., representing the number of electrons gained or lost).
        - 'e' is the elementary charge (**1.6 x 10⁻¹⁹ C**).
    - The **minimum possible charge** that can exist freely is the charge of a single electron or proton.
    - This means a body cannot have a charge like 1.5e or any other random fractional value of 'e'.

### 6. Coulomb's Law of Electrostatics

- **Description**: This law quantifies the **electrostatic force (F)** between two **point charges** (q1 and q2) separated by a distance (r).
- **Statements of the Law**:
    - The electrostatic force is **directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of the two charges (q1q2)**.
    - The electrostatic force is **inversely proportional to the square of the distance (r²)** between their centers.
- **Formula**: **F = k (q1q2 / r²)**.
    - This formula is analogous to Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation (F = Gm1m2/r²).
- **Electrostatic Force Constant (k)**:
    - 'k' is a proportionality constant called the electrostatic force constant.
    - It is **medium-dependent** (its value changes depending on whether the charges are in air, water, vacuum, etc.). Unlike 'G' in gravitation, 'k' is **not a universal constant**.
    - **Value for Free Space (Vacuum or Air)**: **k = 9 x 10⁹ Nm²C⁻²**.
    - 'k' can also be expressed as: **k = 1 / (4πε₀)**.
        - Where **ε₀ (epsilon naught)** is the **Permittivity of Free Space**.
        - **Value of ε₀**: **8.85 x 10⁻¹² N⁻¹m⁻²C²**.
        - ε₀ is also medium-dependent; for other media, it's denoted as ε.
- **Full Formula of Coulomb's Law**: **F = 1 / (4πε₀) (q1q2 / r²)**.
- **Relative Permittivity (κ)** or **Dielectric Constant**:
    - Defined as the ratio of the permittivity of a medium (ε) to the permittivity of free space (ε₀).
    - **Formula**: **κ = ε / ε₀**.
    - This concept is crucial for understanding interactions in different media and will be highly important in the next chapter.

### 7. Electric Field

- **Theoretical Definition**: The **region or space around a charge** where its electrostatic influence can be felt, i.e., where it can apply electrostatic force on other charges.
- **Mathematical Definition**: The **electrostatic force per unit test charge**.
    - **Formula**: **E = F / q₀**.
        - 'E' is the electric field.
        - 'F' is the electrostatic force.
        - 'q₀' is a **test charge**.
- **Properties of Test Charge (q₀)**:
    - It must be **infinitesimally small (vanishingly small)**, almost tending to zero. This is crucial so that the test charge's own field does not significantly influence or alter the source charge's electric field being measured.
    - By convention, a test charge is always considered **positive**. This convention ensures consistent results for electric field direction.
- **SI Unit of Electric Field**: **Newton per Coulomb (N/C)**.
- **Nature of Electric Field**: It is a **vector quantity**.
- **Direction of Electric Field**: Conventionally, the electric field is assumed to travel **from positive charges to negative charges**.
- **Electric Field due to a Point Charge**:
    - **Derivation**:
        - Start with Coulomb's Law for force between source charge Q and test charge q₀: F = kQq₀ / r².
        - Substitute this into the electric field definition E = F / q₀.
        - The test charge q₀ cancels out, leading to a formula for E that is independent of the test charge.
    - **Formula**: **E = kQ / r²**.
    - In free space: **E = 1 / (4πε₀) (Q / r²)**.
    - **Direction**: Radially outward from a positive point charge and radially inward towards a negative point charge.

### 8. Electric Dipole

- **Definition**: A system consisting of **two equal and opposite charges (+q and -q)** separated by a small distance.
    - The distance is conventionally taken as **2a** (or 2l) to simplify calculations in later derivations (allowing 'a' to be the distance from the center to each charge).
- **Electric Dipole Moment (p)**:
    - **Definition**: The product of the magnitude of either charge (q) and the distance (2a) between the charges.
    - **Formula**: **p = q * (2a)**.
    - **SI Unit**: **Coulomb-meter (C·m)**. A small dash is often used between C and m (C-m) to prevent confusion with "centimeter" or "milliCoulomb".
    - **Nature**: It is a **vector quantity**.
    - **Direction**: The direction of the electric dipole moment is conventionally defined **from the negative charge to the positive charge**.

### 9. Electric Field due to an Electric Dipole

The electric field of a dipole is calculated at two special points:

- **At an Axial Point** (a point lying on the axis of the dipole):
    
    - Consider a point P at a distance 'r' from the center of the dipole along its axis.
    - The distance from P to +q is (r - a), and to -q is (r + a).
    - The electric field at P is the vector sum of the fields due to +q and -q.
    - **General Formula**: **E_axial = k * (2pr) / (r² - a²)²**. (The derivation shows a negative sign, -2kpr / (r² - a²)², indicating direction opposite to p for the positive charge side of the axis).
    - **For a Short Dipole (when r >> a)**: The 'a²' term in the denominator can be ignored.
        - **E_axial ≈ k * (2p) / r³**.
        - The direction of E_axial is along the dipole axis, opposite to the dipole moment direction (if 'P' is directed from -q to +q and the point is on the +q side).
- **At an Equatorial Point** (a point on the perpendicular bisector of the dipole):
    
    - Consider a point P at a distance 'r' from the center of the dipole along its perpendicular bisector.
    - The distance from P to both +q and -q is √(r² + a²).
    - When the electric fields due to +q and -q are resolved into components, the components perpendicular to the dipole axis cancel out, and the components parallel to the axis add up.
    - **General Formula**: **E_equatorial = kp / (r² + a²)^(3/2)**.
    - **For a Short Dipole (when r >> a)**: The 'a²' term in the denominator can be ignored.
        - **E_equatorial ≈ kp / r³**.
        - The direction of E_equatorial is **opposite to the direction of the dipole moment**.
- **Ratio of Electric Fields for a Short Dipole**:
    
    - The magnitude of the electric field at an axial point is twice that at an equatorial point for a short dipole.
    - **|E_axial| : |E_equatorial| = 2 : 1**.

### 10. Torque on an Electric Dipole in a Uniform Electric Field

- **Torque**: The turning effect of a force that causes rotation.
- When an electric dipole is placed in a **uniform external electric field (E)**, the +q charge experiences a force **F₁ = qE** in the direction of E, and the -q charge experiences a force **F₂ = -qE** opposite to the direction of E.
- **Net Force**: Since F₁ and F₂ are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, the **net force on the dipole is zero**. This means the dipole experiences **no translational motion** (it doesn't move linearly).
- **Net Torque**: However, the two forces have **different lines of action** (they are applied at different points), which creates a **turning effect or torque** on the dipole, causing it to rotate.
- **Formula (Magnitude)**: **τ = PE sinθ**.
    - 'τ' (tau) is the torque.
    - 'P' is the magnitude of the electric dipole moment.
    - 'E' is the magnitude of the uniform electric field.
    - 'θ' is the angle between the electric dipole moment vector (p) and the electric field vector (E).
- **Formula (Vector Form)**: **τ = p x E** (cross product).
- **Special Cases (Equilibrium)**:
    - **θ = 0°**:
        - sin(0°) = 0, so **τ = 0**.
        - The dipole is aligned with the electric field. This is a state of **Stable Equilibrium**. If slightly displaced, the dipole will return to this orientation. (Analogy: Egg resting on its broad side)
    - **θ = 90°**:
        - sin(90°) = 1, so **τ = PE**.
        - This is the **maximum torque** that can be applied to the dipole.
    - **θ = 180°**:
        - sin(180°) = 0, so **τ = 0**.
        - The dipole is anti-parallel to the electric field (positive charge points against the field). This is a state of **Unstable Equilibrium**. If slightly displaced, the dipole will move away from this orientation and align with the field. (Analogy: Egg balanced on its pointed end)
    - If **both net force and net torque are zero**, the object is in **equilibrium**.

### 11. Electric Field Lines (Electric Lines of Force)

- **Definition**: Imaginary lines in space that represent the **direction and strength of the electric field** around a charge. A small positive test charge, if free to move, would follow these lines. The tangent at any point on an electric field line gives the direction of the electric field at that point.
    
- **Properties of Electric Field Lines**:
    
    1. They are **continuous smooth curves** without any breaks or sudden turns. A sudden turn would imply two directions for the electric field at one point, which is impossible for a single vector.
    2. They **originate from positive charges** and **terminate on negative charges**. They **never form closed loops** (unlike magnetic field lines).
    3. The **tangent to an electric field line at any point gives the direction of the electric field** at that point.
    4. **Two electric field lines can never intersect** each other. If they did, it would mean that at the point of intersection, the electric field would have two different directions, which is impossible.
    5. They always **emerge from or terminate on a charged surface (conductor) perpendicularly (normal)** to the surface.
    6. The **density of field lines (how close they are)** represents the strength of the electric field: **denser lines indicate a stronger field**, while **sparser lines indicate a weaker field**.
    7. They **do not pass through a hollow conductor**. The electric field inside a hollow conductor is zero. This phenomenon is called **Electrostatic Shielding**.
        - **Example**: Staying inside a car during a lightning storm offers protection because the car acts as a hollow conductor, diverting the electric field around it. A demonstration using a metal pot to block phone signals also illustrates this.
- **Shapes of Electric Field Lines for Different Configurations**:
    
    - **Single Positive Point Charge**: Lines emerge radially outward, extending to infinity.
    - **Single Negative Point Charge**: Lines converge radially inward, appearing to originate from infinity.
    - **Electric Dipole (+q and -q)**: Lines emerge from the positive charge and terminate on the negative charge, forming curved paths.
    - **Two Like Charges (+q and +q)**: Lines emerge from both positive charges and repel each other, curving away from the region between them. There is a neutral point in the middle where no field lines are present.
    - **Infinite Plane Sheet of Charge**: The electric field lines are **uniform**, meaning they are straight, parallel, and equally spaced.

### 12. Area Vector

- For the purpose of advanced concepts like Gauss's Theorem, **Area is considered a vector quantity**, unlike in introductory physics where it's a scalar.
- **Direction for Closed Bodies**: For any closed surface (e.g., a cube, sphere), the area vector for any infinitesimal surface element (ds) is always directed **perpendicularly outwards** from the surface.
    - A cube has six distinct area vectors for its six faces.
    - A spherical body has infinitely many area vectors, each normal to its surface at every point.
- **Direction for Open Bodies (e.g., a flat sheet)**: Since there's no clear "outward" direction, the area vector can be chosen in either of the two perpendicular directions. In such cases, it is conventionally chosen to be in the direction that makes the **smaller angle with the electric field**.

### 13. Electric Flux (Φ_E)

- **Definition**: Electric flux is a measure of the **number of electric field lines passing perpendicularly through a given area**. It represents how much of the electric field penetrates a surface.
- **Formula (when E is perpendicular to the area S)**: **Φ_E = E * S**.
- **General Formula (when E is at an angle θ to the area vector S)**: **Φ_E = ES cosθ**.
    - This considers only the component of the electric field that is perpendicular to the surface.
- **Vector Form**: Since it involves the dot product of two vectors (Electric field **E** and Area vector **S**), it is written as: **Φ_E = E · S**.
- **Nature**: Electric flux is a **scalar quantity** (as it is the result of a dot product).
- **SI Unit**: **Newton-meter² per Coulomb (Nm²C⁻¹)**.

### 14. Gauss's Theorem (Gauss's Law)

- **Purpose**: Provides a simpler and powerful way to calculate the **total electric flux through a closed surface** and, in turn, can be used to determine the electric field for symmetric charge distributions.
- **Statement**: The **total electric flux (Φ_E)** passing through any **closed surface** (called a Gaussian surface) is equal to the **net charge enclosed (Q_enclosed)** by that surface divided by the **permittivity of free space (ε₀)**.
- **Formula**: **Φ_E = Q_enclosed / ε₀**.
- **Proof (for a Spherical Charge)**:
    - Start with the general flux definition: Φ_E = ∫ E · dS (over a closed surface).
    - For a spherical Gaussian surface around a point charge Q, the electric field E is radial, and the area vector dS is also radial, so the angle θ between them is 0° (cos 0° = 1).
    - E is constant over the Gaussian surface (kQ/r²), so it can be taken out of the integral: Φ_E = E ∫ dS.
    - The integral of dS over a sphere is its surface area: 4πr².
    - So, Φ_E = (kQ/r²) * (4πr²).
    - Substitute k = 1/(4πε₀): Φ_E = [1/(4πε₀)] * (Q/r²) * (4πr²).
    - Simplifying, Φ_E = Q / ε₀, thus proving Gauss's Law.
- **Gaussian Surface**: A hypothetical, imaginary closed surface chosen strategically around a charge distribution to apply Gauss's Law.
    - It should be chosen such that the electric field is constant in magnitude and perpendicular to the surface, simplifying the flux calculation.

### 15. Applications of Gauss's Law (Electric Field Calculations)

Gauss's Law is primarily used to calculate electric fields for charge distributions with high symmetry:

- **1. Coulomb's Law from Gauss's Law**:
    
    - By applying Gauss's Law to a point charge Q placed at the center of a spherical Gaussian surface, the electric field can be found as E = kQ/r².
    - Using the definition E = F/q₀, one can then derive F = kQq₀/r², which is Coulomb's Law.
- **2. Electric Field due to an Infinitely Long, Straight, Uniformly Charged Wire**:
    
    - **Gaussian Surface**: A coaxial cylindrical surface around the wire.
    - **Linear Charge Density (λ)**: Charge per unit length (Q/L).
    - For the cylindrical surface, flux through the circular ends is zero (E is perpendicular to dS), and flux through the curved surface is E * (2πrL).
    - By Gauss's Law: E * (2πrL) = Q_enclosed / ε₀ = (λL) / ε₀.
    - **Formula**: **E = λ / (2πε₀r)**.
    - **Dependence**: The electric field is **inversely proportional to the distance (r)** from the wire. (E ∝ 1/r).
- **3. Electric Field due to an Infinite Thin Plane Sheet of Uniform Charge**:
    
    - **Gaussian Surface**: A cylindrical surface (or a rectangular prism) passing through the sheet, with its flat faces parallel to the sheet.
    - **Surface Charge Density (σ)**: Charge per unit area (Q/A).
    - Flux passes through the two flat faces of the cylinder (E · dS = E dS cos 0°), but not through the curved surface (E is perpendicular to dS, cos 90° = 0).
    - By Gauss's Law: E * A + E * A = Q_enclosed / ε₀ = (σA) / ε₀.
    - **Formula**: **E = σ / (2ε₀)**.
    - **Dependence**: The electric field is **constant and independent of the distance** from the sheet.
- **4. Electric Field due to a Uniformly Charged Hollow Spherical Shell**:
    
    - **Surface Charge Density (σ)**: Q / (4πR²) where R is the radius of the shell.
    - **a) Outside the sphere (r > R)**:
        - **Gaussian Surface**: A concentric spherical surface of radius 'r' outside the shell.
        - The total charge enclosed is Q.
        - **Formula**: **E_out = σR² / (ε₀r²)** or **E_out = kQ / r²**.
        - **Dependence**: The electric field is **inversely proportional to the square of the distance (r²)** from the center, behaving like a point charge at the center.
    - **b) On the surface of the sphere (r = R)**:
        - Substitute r = R into the outside formula.
        - **Formula**: **E_on = σ / ε₀** or **E_on = kQ / R²**.
    - **c) Inside the sphere (r < R)**:
        - **Gaussian Surface**: A concentric spherical surface of radius 'r' inside the shell.
        - **Total Charge Enclosed**: For a hollow conducting sphere, the charge resides only on its outer surface. Therefore, the **charge enclosed by a Gaussian surface inside the shell is zero**.
        - **Formula**: **E_in = 0**.
    - **Graph of E vs. r**:
        - From the center (r=0) up to the surface (r=R), the electric field is **zero**.
        - At the surface (r=R), the electric field **abruptly increases to its maximum value** (σ/ε₀).
        - Beyond the surface (r > R), the electric field **decreases inversely proportional to r²** (E ∝ 1/r²).

### 16. Problem-Solving Insights and Examples

The video provides several examples, highlighting key concepts:

- **Electric Flux Calculation (Uniform Electric Field)**:
    - Given E and Area, calculate flux using Φ = ES cosθ.
    - **Crucial step**: Determine the angle (θ) between the electric field vector (E) and the area vector (S). If the plane of the surface is parallel to a coordinate plane (e.g., yz-plane), its area vector will be along the perpendicular axis (e.g., x-axis).
- **Graph of Coulomb's Force vs. 1/r²**:
    - Coulomb's force (F) is directly proportional to 1/r² (F ∝ 1/r²). Therefore, a graph of F versus 1/r² will be a **straight line passing through the origin**.
    - The **slope of the F vs. 1/r² graph will be proportional to the product of the charges (q1q2)**. A higher product of charges results in a steeper slope.
- **Gauss's Law and Enclosed Charge**:
    - Electric flux through a closed surface depends **only on the net charge enclosed** by that surface, not on charges outside it.
    - If a dipole (+q and -q) is enclosed by a surface, the **net charge enclosed is zero**, so the **electric flux through that surface is zero**.
    - When a charge is placed at different locations relative to a cube:
        - **At a corner**: It is shared by 8 cubes. Flux through one cube = Q / (8ε₀).
        - **At the midpoint of an edge**: It is shared by 4 cubes. Flux through one cube = Q / (4ε₀).
        - **At the center of a face**: It is shared by 2 cubes. Flux through one cube = Q / (2ε₀).
- **Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) of a Charge**:
    - A complex problem where a charge oscillates due to electrostatic forces.
    - **Strategy**:
        1. Calculate the **net force (F_net)** acting on the oscillating charge.
        2. For SHM, the restoring force is of the form **F = -kx**. Equate F_net to -kx to find the effective spring constant 'k'.
        3. Use the time period formula for SHM: **T = 2π√(m/k)**.
        4. Simplify the expression to match the desired proof.
    - This demonstrates how different physics concepts (electrostatics, forces, SHM) can be combined.
- **Ratio of Maximum Torque**:
    - Maximum torque (τ_max) occurs when θ = 90°, so **τ_max = PE**.
    - Calculate the ratio (P1E1) / (P2E2).
- **Charge Quantization and Transfer**:
    - When charged spheres come into contact and separate, the **total charge is conserved**.
    - The final charge on each sphere will be such that the total charge remains the same, and individual charges must be integral multiples of 'e'.
- **Properties of Electric Field Lines and Force**:
    - Positive charges move along the direction of the electric field.
    - Negative charges move **opposite** to the direction of the electric field, as the force on a negative charge is opposite to E (F = qE, with q being negative).
- **Calculating Charge on a Neutral Object**:
    - A neutral object has an equal number of electrons and protons.
    - **Steps**:
        1. Calculate **moles** of the substance (Given Mass / Molar Mass).
        2. Calculate **number of atoms** (Moles * Avogadro's Number).
        3. Calculate **total number of electrons/protons** (Number of Atoms * Atomic Number/Number of Electrons per atom).
        4. Calculate **total negative charge** (Total Electrons * charge of one electron) and **total positive charge** (Total Protons * charge of one proton).
