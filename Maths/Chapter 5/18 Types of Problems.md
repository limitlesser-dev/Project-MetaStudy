Based on our previous discussion, the chapter contains at least **18 distinct types** of questions covering Continuity, Differentiation Techniques, Parametric Forms, and Higher Order Derivatives.

Here is one question provided by the sources for each of the 18 types:

### I. Continuity

|Type|Question Example|Citation|
|:--|:--|:--|
|**1. Examine Continuity at Specific Points** (Simple function)|**Prove that the function $f(x) = 5x - 3$ is continuous at $x = 0$, at $x = -3$ and at $x = 5$.**||
|**2. Find All Points of Discontinuity** (Rational/Domain restricted)|**Examine the function $f(x) = \frac{1}{x-5}$ for continuity, where $x \neq 5$.** (At $x = 5$, the function is undefined, so it is discontinuous)||
|**3. Analyze Continuity of Function Classes** (Polynomial/Trig functions)|**Show that every polynomial function is continuous.**||
|**4. Check Differentiability at a Point** (Absolute value/Greatest integer)|**Prove that the greatest integer function defined by $f(x) = [x]$, $0 < x < 3$ is not differentiable at $x = 1$ and $x = 2$.**||
|**5. Solve for Constants/Relationships for Continuity** (Piecewise)|**Find the relationship between $a$ and $b$ so that the function $f$ defined by $f(x) = { ax + 1, \text{ if } x \leq 3; bx + 3, \text{ if } x > 3 }$ is continuous at $x = 3$.**||
