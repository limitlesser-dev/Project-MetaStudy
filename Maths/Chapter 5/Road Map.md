This roadmap provides a structured approach to mastering Chapter 5: Continuity and Differentiability, based on the concepts, exercises, and complexity highlighted throughout the sources.

The chapter is described as **"very lengthy"** and requires sequential learning, building confidence through foundational differentiation before moving to advanced techniques.

## Chapter 5: Continuity and Differentiability Roadmap

|Phase|Duration|Focus Areas & Key Concepts|Source References|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Phase 1: Foundations (Continuity)**|4.0 Hours|**Exercise 5.1 (Continuity Checks)**||
|1A. Concept Review|1.0 hr|Understand the condition for continuity at $x=c$: $f(c)$ is defined, $\lim_{x\to c} f(x)$ exists, and $\lim_{x\to c} f(x) = f(c)$. Review graphs: a function is continuous if its graph can be drawn "without lifting the pen".||
|1B. Polynomial & Rational Functions|1.0 hr|Practice confirming that polynomial functions are continuous everywhere. Examine rational functions, noting they are continuous only within their defined domain (i.e., discontinuous where the denominator is zero).||
|1C. Piecewise Functions & Proofs|2.0 hrs|Master checking continuity at critical points by comparing Left-Hand Limit (LHL), Right-Hand Limit (RHL), and the function value (f(a)). Practice solving for unknown constants ($k$, $a$, $b$) required for continuity.||
|**Phase 2: Basic & Implicit Differentiation**|3.5 Hours|**Exercises 5.2 & 5.3 (Basic Rules)**||
|2A. Chain Rule Mastery|1.5 hrs|Practice applying the **Chain Rule** extensively for composite functions, such as $\sin(x^2+5)$. Ensure fluency in standard derivatives (Product, Quotient rules).||
|2B. Implicit Differentiation|1.5 hrs|Practice finding $dy/dx$ when $x$ and $y$ are mixed (implicit functions), remembering to always apply the Chain Rule to $y$ terms (differentiating $y$ yields $dy/dx$).||
|2C. Differentiability Proofs|0.5 hr|Review the concept that every differentiable function is continuous, but the converse is not true. Practice showing non-differentiability using the definition of derivatives (e.g., at sharp points like $|x-1|
|**Phase 3: Advanced Differentiation Techniques**|6.5 Hours|**Exercises 5.3, 5.4, 5.5 (Log, Exp, Inverse)**||
|3A. Inverse Trig Simplification|2.0 hrs|Use trigonometric substitution (e.g., $x = \tan\theta$ or $x = \sin\theta$) to **simplify inverse trigonometric functions** before differentiating to avoid complicated chain rule application.||
|3B. Exponential & Log Derivatives|1.5 hrs|Practice derivatives of basic exponential ($e^x$, $a^x$) and logarithmic functions ($\log x$) and their compositions. Review key logarithmic properties needed for simplification.||
|3C. Logarithmic Differentiation (Complex Products)|1.5 hrs|Apply logarithmic differentiation when multiple terms are multiplied or divided (e.g., $\cos x \cdot \cos 2x \cdot \cos 3x$). This converts products/quotients into sums/differences, simplifying the derivative.||
|3D. Logarithmic Differentiation (Variable Power)|1.5 hrs|Apply logarithmic differentiation when a variable is raised to the power of a variable (e.g., $x^x$ or $(\log x)^{\cos x}$). Practice separating terms connected by addition/subtraction ($u \pm v$) into individual logarithmic differentiations.||
|**Phase 4: Parametric and Higher Order Derivatives**|4.0 Hours|**Exercises 5.6 & 5.7 (Final Techniques)**||
|4A. Parametric Differentiation|2.0 hrs|Find $dy/dx$ when $x$ and $y$ are functions of a third parameter ($t$ or $\theta$), using the formula $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy/dt}{dx/dt}$. Practice simplifying the final result using identities.||
|4B. Second Order Derivatives|2.0 hrs|Calculate the second derivative ($\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$) by differentiating the first derivative ($\frac{dy}{dx}$) again. Focus on solving or verifying complex proof-based differential equations.||

**Total Estimated Study Time:** **18.0 Hours**

This schedule is designed to ensure foundational skills are solid before tackling the complex manipulation and problem-solving required in the later sections. Consistent practice is key, as the sources note that the chapter is "practice वाला ज्यादा है" (more about practice).
