|To-Do Item|Source/Concept Focus|Allotted Time (Estimated)|
|:--|:--|:--|
|**Phase 1: Foundations (Continuity & Basic Differentiation)**|||
|1. Review Continuity Concepts|Understand the condition for continuity at $x=c$: $f(c)$ is defined, $\lim_{x\to c} f(x)$ exists, and $\lim_{x\to c} f(x) = f(c)$. Review graphs where the function requires lifting the pen (discontinuous),.|1.5 Hours|
|2. Practice Continuity Checks (Exercise 5.1)|Work through polynomial and rational function continuity examples,,,,,. Practice checking points of discontinuity for piecewise functions,,,,,.|2.5 Hours|
|3. Practice Basic Derivatives (Exercise 5.2/5.4)|Practice taking derivatives of basic functions, including those involving the Chain Rule, such as $\sin(x^2+5)$,. Ensure mastery of Constant, Polynomial, and simple trigonometric functions.|2.0 Hours|
|**Phase 2: Core Differentiation Techniques**|||
|4. Practice Implicit Differentiation (Exercise 5.3)|Learn to differentiate functions where $x$ and $y$ are mixed (implicit functions), remembering to apply the Chain Rule when differentiating $y$ terms with respect to $x$ (getting $dy/dx$),,,.|2.5 Hours|
|5. Practice Inverse Trigonometric Derivatives (Exercise 5.3/5.4)|Focus on simplifying complex inverse trigonometric expressions using substitutions (like $x = \tan \theta$ or $x = \sin \theta$) before differentiation to avoid lengthy Chain Rule application,,,,.|3.0 Hours|
|**Phase 3: Advanced Techniques (Log, Exp, Parametric)**|||
|6. Practice Logarithmic Differentiation (Exercise 5.5)|Apply the Logarithmic Differentiation technique for complex products, quotients, or functions where a variable is raised to the power of a variable (e.g., $f(x)^{g(x)}$ or $u \cdot v \cdot w$),,,.|3.0 Hours|
|7. Practice Exponential & Log Derivatives (Exercise 5.4/5.5)|Apply the specific rules for $e^x$ and $\log x$. Practice differentiating functions like $a^x$ and compositions like $\log(\cos e^x)$.|2.0 Hours|
|8. Practice Parametric Differentiation (Exercise 5.6)|Find $\frac{dy}{dx}$ when $x$ and $y$ are defined by a third parameter, $t$ or $\theta$, using the formula $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy/dt}{dx/dt}$,. Practice required simplification using trigonometric identities,.|2.0 Hours|
|**Phase 4: Higher Order Derivatives & Review**|||
|9. Practice Second Order Derivatives (Exercise 5.7)|Calculate the second derivative ($\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$) by differentiating the first derivative ($\frac{dy}{dx}$) again,. Focus on important proofing questions and handling second derivatives for parametric functions,,.|3.5 Hours|
|10. Comprehensive Review and High-Level Questions|Review the relationship that every differentiable function is continuous, but the converse is not true (e.g., $f(x)=|x|

**Note on Study Approach:**

The sources describe this chapter as a "super one shot" and "very lengthy". It is highly recommended that you **do not try to complete this in a single sitting**. Break the tasks into distinct study sessions.

If you struggle with the basic derivative rules (like polynomial or $x^n$), refer back to the basics of differentiation, as proficiency in this area is fundamental to successfully completing the high-level questions involving Chain Rule, Logarithmic Differentiation, and Parametric functions,,,.
