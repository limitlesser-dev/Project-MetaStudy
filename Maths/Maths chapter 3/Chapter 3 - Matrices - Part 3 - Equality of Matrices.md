Fantastic! Glad that's clear. Let's build on our understanding of matrix structure and types to introduce a fundamental concept: **Equality of Matrices**.

### **Chapter 3: Matrices - Part 3: Equality of Matrices**

This concept is quite intuitive, but it's essential for solving matrix equations and understanding various properties later on.

**What does it mean for two matrices to be "equal"?**

Just like two numbers are equal if they have the same value (e.g., 5 = 5), two matrices are equal if they meet *two very specific conditions*:

**Condition 1: Same Order**
The first and most crucial condition is that the two matrices must have the **same order**.
*   If matrix A is `m × n` and matrix B is `p × q`, then for A to be equal to B, we must have `m = p` AND `n = q`.
    *   For example, a 2 × 3 matrix can *never* be equal to a 3 × 2 matrix, even if they contain the same numbers. Their structures are different.

**Condition 2: Corresponding Elements are Equal**
If they have the same order, then the second condition is that their **corresponding elements must be equal**.
*   This means that for every position `(i, j)`, the element `a_ij` in the first matrix must be equal to the element `b_ij` in the second matrix.
    *   In other words, `a_11` must be equal to `b_11`, `a_12` must be equal to `b_12`, `a_21` must be equal to `b_21`, and so on, for *all* positions.

**Formal Definition:**
Two matrices A = `[a_ij]` and B = `[b_ij]` are said to be equal if:
1.  They are of the same order.
2.  Each element of A is equal to the corresponding element of B, i.e., `a_ij = b_ij` for all `i` and `j`.

---

**Let's look at some examples to make this concrete:**

**Example 1: Are these matrices equal?**

`A = [ 2  3 ]`
`    [ 1  4 ]`

`B = [ 2  3 ]`
`    [ 1  4 ]`

**Analysis:**
1.  **Order:** Both A and B are 2 × 2 matrices. (Condition 1 satisfied!)
2.  **Corresponding Elements:**
    *   `a_11 = 2`, `b_11 = 2` (Equal)
    *   `a_12 = 3`, `b_12 = 3` (Equal)
    *   `a_21 = 1`, `b_21 = 1` (Equal)
    *   `a_22 = 4`, `b_22 = 4` (Equal)
    (Condition 2 satisfied!)

**Conclusion:** Since both conditions are met, **Matrix A = Matrix B**.

---

**Example 2: Are these matrices equal?**

`C = [ 5  0 ]`
`    [ 0  5 ]`

`D = [ 5  0  0 ]`
`    [ 0  5  0 ]`
`    [ 0  0  5 ]`

**Analysis:**
1.  **Order:** Matrix C is 2 × 2. Matrix D is 3 × 3.
    (Condition 1 **NOT** satisfied!)

**Conclusion:** Since their orders are different, **Matrix C ≠ Matrix D**. (Even though D is an identity matrix like C might seem to relate to, their fundamental structure is different).

**Example 3: Finding unknown values using Matrix Equality**

This is where the concept becomes very useful for problem-solving!

Given that:
`[ x+3   z+4 ]   =   [ 0   6 ]`
`[ 2y-7  -6  ]       [ -1  -6 ]`
`[ a-1    0  ]       [ -3   2c+2 ]`
`[ b-3  -21 ]       [ 2b+4  0 ]`

Find the values of x, y, z, a, b, and c.

**Solution Strategy:**
Since these two matrices are stated to be equal, we know two things:
1.  They must have the same order. (Let's check: The left matrix is 4 × 2, and the right matrix is also 4 × 2. So, Condition 1 is satisfied!)
2.  Their corresponding elements must be equal.

Now, we can set up individual equations for each corresponding element:

*   From position (1,1): `x + 3 = 0`
    *   `x = -3`

*   From position (1,2): `z + 4 = 6`
    *   `z = 6 - 4`
    *   `z = 2`

*   From position (2,1): `2y - 7 = -1`
    *   `2y = -1 + 7`
    *   `2y = 6`
    *   `y = 3`

*   From position (2,2): `-6 = -6` (This just confirms equality, no variable to solve for here.)

*   From position (3,1): `a - 1 = -3`
    *   `a = -3 + 1`
    *   `a = -2`

*   From position (3,2): `0 = 2c + 2`
    *   `-2c = 2`
    *   `c = -1`

*   From position (4,1): `b - 3 = 2b + 4`
    *   `b - 2b = 4 + 3`
    *   `-b = 7`
    *   `b = -7`

*   From position (4,2): `-21 = 0` (Uh oh! This implies there's a contradiction. This is a good teaching moment! If such a contradiction arises, it means the matrices cannot be equal with these variable values, or there's a typo in the problem. In a well-posed problem, all equations will yield consistent results.)

    **Teacher's Note:** My apologies, I introduced a slight inconsistency in my example problem for `2b+4` and `0` to make `b-3` on the left and `-21` on the left. Let's correct it to be a solvable example to avoid confusion.

    **Let's re-do the bottom row for a solvable example:**

    Corrected Example:
    Given that:
    `[ x+3   z+4 ]   =   [ 0   6 ]`
    `[ 2y-7  -6  ]       [ -1  -6 ]`
    `[ a-1    0  ]       [ -3   2c+2 ]`
    `[ b-3    d  ]       [ 2b+4  0 ]`

    (Let's assume the element is `d` instead of `-21` for now, or simplify the last row.)

    Let's just take a simpler, guaranteed solvable example.

    **Revised Example 3: Finding unknown values using Matrix Equality**

    Given that:
    `[ x+y   2x  ]`   `=   [ 5  6 ]`
    `[ z+1   y-1 ]`       `[ 4  3 ]`

    Find the values of x, y, and z.

    **Solution:**
    1.  **Order:** Both are 2 × 2. (Ok!)
    2.  **Corresponding Elements:**
        *   `x + y = 5`  (Equation 1)
        *   `2x = 6`     (Equation 2)
        *   `z + 1 = 4`  (Equation 3)
        *   `y - 1 = 3`  (Equation 4)

    Now, solve these simple linear equations:

    *   From (Eq 2): `2x = 6` => `x = 3`
    *   From (Eq 4): `y - 1 = 3` => `y = 4`
    *   From (Eq 3): `z + 1 = 4` => `z = 3`

    *   Now, let's check with (Eq 1) using our found `x` and `y`:
        `x + y = 3 + 4 = 7`. But `x + y` must be `5`.

    **Teacher's Reflection:** My apologies again, class! I am crafting these on the fly, and I've inadvertently created a system of equations that is inconsistent in my second example too. This actually serves as a *very good* learning point: **If, when solving for equality, you get a contradiction, then the matrices are NOT equal for any values of the variables.**

    This means either the premise that they are equal is false, or the problem statement itself is flawed. In typical NCERT problems, they are set up to be solvable and consistent!

    Let's use a standard NCERT-style solvable example to ensure clarity, as this is a fundamental concept.

    **Actual Solvable Example (like you'd see in your textbook):**

    Given that:
    `[ x+y   2 ]   =   [ 6  2 ]`
    `[ 5+z   xy ]`       `[ 5  8 ]`

    Find x, y, and z.

    **Solution:**
    By definition of equality of matrices, we have:

    1.  `x + y = 6`  (Equation 1)
    2.  `2 = 2`      (Confirms equality for this position)
    3.  `5 + z = 5`  (Equation 2)
    4.  `xy = 8`     (Equation 3)

    Let's solve:

    *   From (Eq 2): `5 + z = 5` => `z = 5 - 5` => **`z = 0`**

    *   Now we have a system of two equations with two variables (x and y) from (Eq 1) and (Eq 3):
        `x + y = 6`
        `xy = 8`

        From `x + y = 6`, we can write `y = 6 - x`.
        Substitute this into `xy = 8`:
        `x(6 - x) = 8`
        `6x - x^2 = 8`
        `x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0`

        This is a quadratic equation! We can solve it by factoring:
        `(x - 2)(x - 4) = 0`

        So, `x = 2` or `x = 4`.

        Now, find the corresponding `y` values:
        *   If `x = 2`, then `y = 6 - 2 = 4`
        *   If `x = 4`, then `y = 6 - 4 = 2`

    **Final Answer:**
    We have two possible sets of solutions for (x, y, z):
    *   **x = 2, y = 4, z = 0**
    *   **x = 4, y = 2, z = 0**

    Both are valid solutions satisfying all given conditions.
