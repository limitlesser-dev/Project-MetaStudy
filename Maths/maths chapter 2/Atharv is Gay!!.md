The project is multi-faceted, encompassing goals related to technical innovation, product functionality, and personal career advancement.

The primary goal of the project is to **create a highly effective project management and brainstorming system** that overcomes the limitations found in current AI large language models (LLMs).

### 1. Technical and Functional Goals

The core functional goal is to create a system that acts as a **"Real Based Thinking Partner"** and a **"Dashboard"** for project management where everything is managed and tracked.

The project aims to solve major problems with current AI systems:

- **Solve Context Failure:** The current AI systems (like ChatGPT and Gemini) use a simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) based architecture. This architecture relies on similarity-based retrieval, which means conversations are stored and retrieved based on word similarity. This often leads to irrelevant conversations mixing in, creating a very large and cluttered context window.
- **Implement a Hybrid Database:** To counter this, a key goal is to implement a **hybrid database** that uses **relatability** rather than just similarity to retrieve necessary context. This ensures the system retrieves only the necessary context for the discussion.
- **Focus the Conversation:** The system aims to **keep the product on track** by providing suggestions and pointing out contradictory ideas that conflict with the overall project goals and context derived from past discussions (threads).
- **Reduce Cognitive Load:** The system is intended to simplify the process of gathering and managing research, thereby reducing the user's cognitive load.

### 2. Product Vision and Output

The overall product is focused on formalizing fragmented ideas and conversations into organized documentation:

- **Initial Concept ("Belief"):** The core idea is named **"Belief"**. It started with the aim of making **PowerPoint presentations (PPTs) more interesting** and integrating AI so that the AI could pitch the presentation.
- **Formalized Documentation:** The system's output includes **Threads** (sub-topics) which formalize project components (like "Ideation," "Backend," etc.) by removing "noise" from the fragmented chat history. These threads serve as a **"Project's Profile Picture"** and contain details like the idea name, user audience, purpose, problems, and solved issues.
- **Desired Response Quality:** The goal is to produce responses that are not simple question-and-answer formats, which current models are trained on, but rather complex, detailed, and non-linear responses suitable for brainstorming.

### 3. Immediate Goal: The MVP

The immediate, crucial goal is to stop brainstorming and theory and begin the **action phase** by creating a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** or a **working prototype**.

- **Purpose of the MVP:** The MVP must be the simplest form of the product possible, yet still be capable of conveying the vision of the final product. Creating the MVP is prioritized over developing future goals or theoretical write-ups, as the construction process itself will help resolve the necessary theories and subsequent steps.

### 4. Broader and Career Goals

Beyond the technical deliverables, the project is viewed as a significant step for the creator:

- **Personal Use First:** The first step is to build the product to a level where the creator himself can use it.
- **Leveraging for Exposure:** A key goal is to complete the project and use it as a profile leverager, specifically aiming to align with **Scaler**. The creator wants to involve Scaler as a partner to gain exposure and secure funding quickly through their network of experienced engineers.
- **Long-term Goal:** The creator aims to expand his knowledge into business concepts and eventually use the financial success derived from this and future projects to set up his life well enough to **retire by age 27 or 30**.
