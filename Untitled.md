## 📺 Lecture Structure & Focus

The instructor notes that the session is split into two main parts:

1.  **Concepts & Derivations (Approx. 2 hours):** This section uses pre-recorded material to cover the fundamental theory in detail, including derivations. Viewers who have seen the previous year's "One Shot" can skip this part.
2.  **Questions & Practice:** The latter half of the video focuses heavily on solving problems, including:
    *   Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)
    *   Assertion and Reason questions
    *   Subjective questions
    *   Competency Focused Practice Questions (CFPQ)
    
The emphasis on questions is due to the increasing difficulty of the physics board exams.

## 📚 Core Concepts

The study of electric charges is broadly divided into two areas:

*   **[[Electrostatics]]**: The study of electric charges **at rest**.
    *   *Corresponds to CBSE Chapters 1 & 2.*
*   **[[Electrodynamics]]**: The study of electric charges **in motion**.
    *   *Corresponds to CBSE Chapters 3, 4, and subsequent chapters.*

### Electric Charge

**Definition:** A property of a substance which arises due to either **loss or gain of electrons** by an atom.

*   **SI Unit:** Coulomb ($\text{C}$)
*   **Charge on 1 electron:** $-1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$

| Type of Charge | Development | Condition | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Positive Charge** | Developed due to loss of electrons. | Protons ($p^+$) > Electrons ($e^-$) | $\text{Na}^+, \text{Ca}^{+2}, \text{Al}^{+3}$ |
| **Negative Charge** | Developed due to gain of electrons. | Electrons ($e^-$) > Protons ($p^+$) | $\text{Cl}^-, \text{S}^{-2}, \text{O}^{-2}$ |

## 🧠 Basic Properties of Electric Charge

Electric charge exhibits three fundamental properties:

1.  **Additivity of Electric Charge**
    *   **Meaning:** The total charge of a system is the **algebraic sum** of all the individual charges located at different points inside the system.
    *   **Example:** A system with charges $+5\text{ C}, -3\text{ C}, +10\text{ C}, \text{ and } -5\text{ C}$.
        $$Q_{\text{net}} = (+5) + (-3) + (+10) + (-5) = +7\text{ C}$$

2.  **Conservation of Charge**
    *   **Law:**
        *   The total charge of an **isolated system** remains constant.
        *   Electric charges can **neither be created nor be destroyed**; they can only be **transferred** from one body to another.

3.  **Quantization of Electric Charge**
    *   **Meaning:** Electric charge **cannot vary continuously** to have any arbitrary value. It changes in discrete amounts, like small packets.
    *   **Rule:** The total charge ($Q$) of a body is always an **integral multiple** of the basic quantum of charge ($e$).
        $$Q = n \cdot e$$
        Where $n$ is an integer ($n = \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \dots$) and $e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$.

## ✨ Charging Methods & Detection

### [[Electrostatic Induction]]

**Definition:** The process in which **redistribution of charge** takes place within a body when an electrically charged body is brought **near to it**.

> [!CAUTION] The attraction between a charged and an uncharged body is possible, but **repulsion is never possible** between a charged and an uncharged body.

*   When a positively charged rod is brought near an uncharged body (which has equal positive and negative charges distributed evenly), the negative charges are attracted to the near side, and the positive charges are repelled to the far side. This non-uniform distribution leads to an *attractive* force.

### [[Gold-leaf electroscope]]

**Definition:** A device which is used to **detect the presence of charge** on a body by the principle of [[Electrostatic Induction]].

*   **Principle:** When a charged body is brought near the metal disc of the electroscope, charge is induced on the metal leaves at the bottom. Since both leaves get the **same type of charge** (either both positive or both negative), they **repel** each other, causing them to move apart. The movement of the leaves confirms the presence of charge on the test body.

# [[Electrostatics: Core Concepts and Formulas]]

## Coulomb's Law of Electrostatics
(Video Timestamp: 30:00 - 34:03)

Coulomb's law describes the electrostatic force ($\vec{F}$) between two point charges ($q_1$ and $q_2$) separated by a distance ($r$).

### Principles:
1.  **Direct Proportionality to Charge:** The magnitude of the electrostatic force is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of the two charges.
    $$F \propto q_1 q_2$$
2.  **Inverse Square Law:** The magnitude of the electrostatic force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the charges.
    $$F \propto \frac{1}{r^2}$$

### Formula (Combined):
$$F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}$$
Where $k$ is the electrostatic force constant.

> [!NOTE] Electrostatic Force Constant ($k$)
> -   It is **medium-dependent**.
> -   For *free space* (vacuum or air, generally), the value is:
>     $$k = 9 \times 10^9 \, \text{N m}^2 \text{C}^{-2}$$
> -   The constant $k$ is also defined in terms of the permittivity of free space ($\epsilon_0$):
>     $$k = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$$
> -   The value of $\epsilon_0$ is approximately:
>     $$\epsilon_0 \approx 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{N}^{-1} \text{m}^{-2} \text{C}^{2}$$

## Relative Permittivity / Dielectric Constant ($K$ or $\epsilon_r$)
(Video Timestamp: 37:22 - 39:13)

> [!definition] Relative Permittivity ($K$)
> The relative permittivity (or Dielectric Constant) is the ratio of the permittivity of a medium ($\epsilon$) to the permittivity of free space ($\epsilon_0$).
> $$K = \epsilon_r = \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}$$
> This constant indicates how a medium influences the force between charges placed in it.

## Electric Field ($\vec{E}$)
(Video Timestamp: 39:13 - 45:59)

> [!definition] Conceptual Definition
> The electric field is the **region or space around a charge** up to which it can exert an electrostatic force or influence on other charges.

> [!definition] Mathematical Definition
> The electric field ($\vec{E}$) at any point is defined as the **electrostatic force ($\vec{F}$) per unit positive test charge ($q_0$)** placed at that point.
> $$\vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}}{q_0}$$

> [!NOTE] Properties of the Test Charge ($q_0$):
> 1.  **Infinitesimally Small:** $q_0 \to 0$. This is necessary so that the test charge does not disturb the electric field created by the *Source Charge*.
> 2.  **Positive:** $q_0$ is always considered a **positive charge** by convention.

### [[Electric Field: Unit and Direction]]
*   **SI Unit:** From the formula $\vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}}{q_0}$, the unit is $\text{N C}^{-1}$ (Newton per Coulomb).
*   **Nature:** It is a **vector quantity**.
*   **Direction:** The direction of the electric field is conventionally taken to be the direction of the force exerted on a *positive* test charge, which is **away from a positive source charge** and **towards a negative source charge**.

### Electric Field for a Point Charge (Source Charge $q$)
(Video Timestamp: 45:59 - 48:25)

By substituting the Coulomb's Law formula ($F = k \frac{q q_0}{r^2}$) into the electric field definition ($E = \frac{F}{q_0}$), we can derive the formula for the electric field at a distance $r$ due to a single source charge $q$.

$$E = \frac{k \frac{q q_0}{r^2}}{q_0}$$
The test charge $q_0$ cancels out, demonstrating that the electric field *only* depends on the **source charge** ($q$) and the distance ($r$).

$$\vec{E} = k \frac{q}{r^2}$$
Or, using permittivity notation:
$$\vec{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2}$$

## Electric Dipole
(Video Timestamp: 48:25 - 53:45)

> [!definition] Electric Dipole
> A system of **two equal and opposite charges** (e.g., $+q$ and $-q$) separated by a small distance, conventionally denoted as $2a$ (or $2l$).

### Electric Dipole Moment ($\vec{p}$)
*   **Definition:** The electric dipole moment is the measure of the strength of an electric dipole. It is the product of the magnitude of either charge and the distance ($2a$) between them.
*   **Formula:**
    $$p = q \times (2a)$$
*   **SI Unit:** Coulomb-meter ($\text{C} \cdot \text{m}$).
*   **Nature:** It is a **vector quantity**.
*   **Direction:** By convention, the direction of the electric dipole moment is from the **negative charge ($-q$) to the positive charge ($+q$)**.

## Electric Field at Axial Point of a Dipole
(Video Timestamp: 53:45 - End)

The derivation calculates the net electric field ($E_{\text{axial}}$) at a point P on the axis of the dipole. The point P is at a distance $r$ from the center of the dipole.

### Setup:
*   Dipole charges: $+q$ and $-q$.
*   Distance between charges: $2a$.
*   Distance from dipole center to point P: $r$.
*   Distance from $+q$ to P: $(r-a)$.
*   Distance from $-q$ to P: $(r+a)$.

### Formula (General):
The resultant electric field is the vector sum of the fields due to $+q$ and $-q$:
$$E_{\text{axial}} = E_{+q} + E_{-q}$$

Substituting the point charge formula ($E = k \frac{q}{r^2}$) and performing the vector subtraction (since $E_{+q}$ is stronger and opposite in direction to $E_{-q}$ in the initial setup):
$$E_{\text{axial}} = k q \left[ \frac{1}{(r-a)^2} - \frac{1}{(r+a)^2} \right]$$

*After algebraic simplification (as shown in the video):*
$$E_{\text{axial}} = \frac{2kpr}{(r^2-a^2)^2}$$
(Note: The direction of $E_{\text{axial}}$ is in the direction of the dipole moment, from $-q$ to $+q$).

### Formula (Short Dipole Approximation)
For a short dipole, the distance between the charges ($2a$) is much smaller than the distance to the point P ($r$).
$$2a \ll r \implies a^2 \approx 0$$
Ignoring $a^2$ in the denominator: $r^2 - a^2 \approx r^2$.
$$E_{\text{axial}} \approx \frac{2kpr}{(r^2)^2} = \frac{2kpr}{r^4}$$
$$E_{\text{axial}} \approx \frac{2kp}{r^3}$$
