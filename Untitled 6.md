# NCERT Class 12 Chemistry - Chapter 1: Solutions

## **Topic 1: Introduction to Solutions**

### **1.1 What are Solutions?**

Let's start with a very basic, everyday observation. Imagine you add a spoon of sugar to a glass of water and stir it. What happens? The sugar disappears, right? And the water still looks like water, but now it tastes sweet and consistently sweet throughout. That, my friends, is a solution!

In chemistry, a **solution** is defined as a **homogeneous mixture** of two or more components.

"**Homogeneous mixture**" is a key term here. It simply means that the composition and properties are uniform throughout the entire mixture. You can't see the individual sugar particles anymore, nor can you filter them out easily. Every drop of that sugar water is exactly the same as any other drop in terms of its sweetness and appearance.

*   **Think of it like this:**
    *   **Homogeneous (Uniform):** Like perfectly blended paint, where every part has the same color.
    *   **Heterogeneous (Non-uniform):** Like sand and water, where you can clearly see the sand settled at the bottom.

### **1.2 Components of a Solution: Solute and Solvent**

Every solution has at least two main parts:

1.  **Solvent:** This is the component that is usually present in the **largest quantity**. It's the substance that dissolves the other component(s). Think of it as the "dissolving medium."
    *   *Example:* In our sugar water, **water** is the solvent because there's more of it, and it's doing the dissolving.

2.  **Solute:** This is the component(s) present in **smaller quantities**. It's the substance that gets dissolved in the solvent.
    *   *Example:* In our sugar water, **sugar** is the solute because it's present in a smaller amount and it's what gets dissolved.

**Simple Analogy:** Imagine a party. The **solvent** is like the "host" – it's present in the largest quantity and welcomes everyone. The **solute(s)** are the "guests" – they come in smaller numbers and are welcomed into the host's space.

### **1.3 Types of Solutions**

Solutions aren't just liquids! We often think of dissolving solids in liquids, but solutions can exist in all three states of matter (solid, liquid, and gas), depending on the physical states of the solute and solvent.

Here's a table summarizing the different types, with everyday examples:

| State of Solute | State of Solvent | Common Example                                    | Explanation                                                                         |
| :-------------- | :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gas             | Gas              | Air                                               | Mixture of nitrogen (solvent), oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide (solutes), etc.        |
| Gas             | Liquid           | Aerated drinks (soda), Oxygen dissolved in water | CO₂ gas dissolved in water (soda), O₂ gas dissolved in water (for aquatic life).    |
| Gas             | Solid            | Solution of hydrogen in palladium                 | Hydrogen gas gets adsorbed and dissolves within the solid palladium metal.          |
| Liquid          | Gas              | Chloroform mixed with nitrogen gas                | Liquid chloroform vaporizes and mixes homogeneously with nitrogen gas.              |
| Liquid          | Liquid           | Ethanol in water (alcohol and water)              | Both are liquids, and they mix completely to form a homogeneous solution.           |
| Liquid          | Solid            | Amalgam of mercury with sodium                    | Mercury (liquid) dissolves in solid sodium metal. (Used in dentistry sometimes).   |
| Solid           | Gas              | Iodized air (iodine vapor in air)                 | Solid iodine sublimates (turns directly into gas) and mixes with air.               |
| Solid           | Liquid           | Sugar in water, Salt in water                     | Most common type: Solid sugar or salt dissolves in liquid water.                    |
| Solid           | Solid            | Alloys (Brass, Bronze, Gold jewelry)              | Brass is a mixture of copper and zinc; bronze is copper and tin. Gold jewelry is gold mixed with copper/silver. |

**Key takeaway for today:** A solution is a uniform mixture where one substance (the solute) is perfectly blended into another (the solvent). And they come in many forms, not just liquids!
