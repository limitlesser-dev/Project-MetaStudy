1. **GOC Basics:** Carbocation stability, rearrangement, resonance, and hyperconjugation.
2. **Naming Rules:** Basic IUPAC nomenclature.
3. **Bond Types:** Sigma ($\sigma$) and Pi ($\pi$) bonds.
4. **Chemical Kinetics:** Rate determining step (RDS) and rate equations.

## **Part 1: Haloalkanes and Stereochemistry**

### **I. Classification and Nomenclature**

This section is fundamental, with questions appearing in recent years (2021-2024).

1. **Definitions:** Understand the core difference: **Haloalkanes** have the halogen atom attached to an $sp^3$ hybridized carbon atom, while **Haloarenes** have the halogen attached to an $sp^2$ hybridized carbon atom of an aryl group.
2. **Based on Number of Halogens:** Classify as Mono-, Di-, or Polyhalogen compounds.
    - **Dihalides:** Differentiate between **Geminal** (two halogens on the same carbon, e.g., $CH_3CHCl_2$) and **Vicinal** (halogens on adjacent carbons).
3. **Based on Hybridization ($sp^3$ C—X Bond):**
    - **Alkyl Halides (R—X):** Classified by the degree of the carbon holding the halogen: Primary (1°), Secondary (2°), or Tertiary (3°).
    - **Allylic Halides:** Halogen bonded to an $sp^3$-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to a C=C double bond.
    - **Benzylic Halides:** Halogen bonded to an $sp^3$-hybridized carbon atom attached to an aromatic ring.
4. **Based on Hybridization ($sp^2$ C—X Bond):**
    - **Vinylic Halides:** Halogen bonded directly to an $sp^2$-hybridized carbon of a C=C double bond.
    - **Aryl Halides:** Halogen bonded directly to the $sp^2$-hybridized carbon of an aromatic ring.
5. **Nomenclature:** Focus primarily on **IUPAC naming** rules. Remember that halogens are treated as substituents and priority rules apply (e.g., double bonds are generally prioritized over substituents).

### **II. Physical Properties (Focus on Trends)**

This area has frequent questions, especially regarding boiling and melting points.

1. **Boiling Point (BP):**
    - Haloalkanes have higher BP than parent hydrocarbons due to stronger intermolecular forces (dipole-dipole and **van der Waals forces**).
    - **Mass Dependence:** For the same alkyl group (R), BP increases with molar mass: **RI > RBr > RCl > RF**.
    - **Branching Effect (Isomers):** BP decreases as branching increases, due to reduced surface area and weaker van der Waals forces.
2. **Melting Point (MP):**
    - Focus on Dihalobenzenes: **Para-isomers** have higher melting points than _ortho_- and _meta_-isomers because their **symmetry** allows for better fitting into the crystal lattice.
3. **Density:** Density increases with increasing number of carbon atoms, halogen atoms, and atomic mass of the halogen. Bromides, iodides, and polychloro derivatives are typically heavier than water.
4. **Solubility:** Haloalkanes are **slightly soluble/insoluble in water** (a polar solvent) but **soluble in organic (non-polar) solvents** because the forces required to break water's hydrogen bonds are greater than the energy released when new haloalkane-water attractions form. They follow the "like dissolves like" principle.

### **III. Stereochemical Aspects (Optical Isomerism)**

This topic is crucial for understanding the $S_N1$ and $S_N2$ mechanisms.

1. **Key Terms:**
    - **Chiral/Asymmetric Carbon:** An $sp^3$ hybridized carbon atom attached to **four different atoms or groups**. Chiral molecules are optically active.
    - **Optical Activity:** The ability of a compound to rotate the plane of plane polarized light. Measured by a polarimeter.
    - **Dextrorotatory (+):** Clockwise rotation.
    - **Laevorotatory (–):** Anti-clockwise rotation.
    - **Enantiomers:** Stereoisomers that are **non-superimposable mirror images** of each other. They have identical physical and chemical properties, differing only in the direction of optical rotation (equal magnitude, opposite sign).
    - **Racemic Mixture:** An equimolar (50:50) mixture of two enantiomers. It is **optically inactive** due to external compensation (the opposite rotations cancel out).

### **IV. Chemical Reactions of Haloalkanes (Highest Priority)**

This is the most frequently tested section.

#### **A. Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions ($S_N1$ and $S_N2$)**

1. **$S_N1$ (Substitution Nucleophilic Unimolecular):**
    - **Mechanism:** Multi-step reaction involving the formation of a **carbocation intermediate** in the slow (rate-determining) step.
    - **Kinetics:** First-order (Rate depends only on the concentration of the alkyl halide). The nucleophile has **no impact** on the reaction rate.
    - **Reactivity Order:** Determined by carbocation stability: **$3^\circ > 2^\circ > 1^\circ$ > Methyl**. Allylic and Benzylic halides show high $S_N1$ reactivity due to resonance stabilization of their carbocations.
    - **Stereochemistry:** The planar carbocation allows nucleophilic attack from either side, resulting in a **Racemic Mixture** (50% retention, 50% inversion).
2. **$S_N2$ (Substitution Nucleophilic Bimolecular):**
    - **Mechanism:** Single- step reaction involving simultaneous bond breaking and bond formation via an unstable transition state. No intermediate (like a carbocation) is formed.
    - **Kinetics:** Second-order (Rate depends on the concentration of both alkyl halide and nucleophile).
    - **Reactivity Order:** Determined by **steric hindrance** (bulkiness of groups): **Methyl > $1^\circ > 2^\circ > 3^\circ$**.
    - **Stereochemistry:** Nucleophile always attacks from the back side (opposite the leaving group), resulting in complete **Inversion of Configuration** (Walden Inversion).
3. **Leaving Group Ability:** For both $S_N1$ and $S_N2$, reactivity follows the order of bond strength/size: **R—I > R—Br > R—Cl >> R—F**.
4. **Ambident Nucleophiles:** These groups (like Cyanide or Nitrite) possess two nucleophilic centers.
    - **KCN (Ionic):** Attack primarily through the Carbon atom (forms R—CN, nitrile) because the C—C bond is more stable than C—N.
    - **AgCN (Covalent):** Carbon is bonded to Ag, so Nitrogen is free to attack (forms R—NC, isocyanide).
5. **Non-Reactive Halides:** Vinylic and Aryl halides (haloarenes) show **no $S_N1$ or $S_N2$ reactivity** under normal conditions due to the double bond character developed through resonance.

#### **B. Elimination Reactions**

1. **Dehydrohalogenation ($\beta$-Elimination):** Haloalkanes containing a $\beta$-hydrogen atom react with a strong base (like **alcoholic KOH**) upon heating.
2. **Process:** Elimination of hydrogen from the $\beta$-carbon and halogen from the $\alpha$-carbon results in the formation of an **alkene**.
3. **Saytzeff's Rule:** When multiple alkenes can form, the **major product** is the alkene which has the **greater number of alkyl groups attached to the doubly bonded carbon atoms** (the more substituted alkene).

#### **C. Reaction with Metals**

1. **Grignard Reagent ($RMgX$):** Formed by reacting alkyl halide ($R—X$) with Magnesium ($Mg$) in **dry ether**.
    - **Importance:** Carbon holds a partial negative charge (carbanion character) and is highly reactive.
    - **Condition:** Must be prepared under **anhydrous conditions (dry ether)** because it reacts rapidly with any source of proton (like water, alcohol, or amines) to form hydrocarbons, thus destroying the reagent.
2. **Wurtz Reaction:** Alkyl halides react with sodium ($Na$) in dry ether to form **hydrocarbons containing double the number of carbon atoms** present in the original halide.

## **Part 2: Haloarenes**

### **V. Methods of Preparation (MOP) of Haloarenes**

1. **Electrophilic Substitution:** Arene reacts with halogen ($X_2$) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (e.g., $FeCl_3$).
2. **From Diazonium Salts (BDS):** Preparation via Sandmeyer's reaction (using $Cu_2Cl_2$ or $Cu_2Br_2$ to attach Cl or Br). Iodine attachment is done simply by shaking with $KI$. Fluorine attachment uses the Balz-Schiemann reaction ($HBF_4$).

### **VI. Chemical Reactions of Haloarenes**

1. **Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions:**
    - **Reactivity:** Aryl halides are **extremely less reactive** toward nucleophilic substitution under normal conditions.
    - **Reasons for Low Reactivity:**
        - **Resonance Effect:** Develops partial double bond character between C and X, making bond cleavage difficult.
        - **Hybridization Difference:** The carbon atom is $sp^2$ hybridized, which has greater $s$-character, making the C—X bond shorter, stronger, and harder to break compared to $sp^3$ C—X bonds in haloalkanes.
        - **Instability of Phenyl Cation:** SN1 is ruled out because the resulting phenyl cation is highly unstable.
    - **Forced Reaction:** Reaction can occur under **drastic conditions** (e.g., high temperature and pressure).
    - **Reactivity Enhancement:** The presence of Electron Withdrawing Groups (like $-NO_2$) at **ortho- and para-positions** significantly increases reactivity by stabilizing the intermediate carbanion through resonance.
2. **Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):**
    - Halogens are $o, p$-directing but are **weakly deactivating**.
    - **Reason:** The strong electron-withdrawing **Inductive Effect (—I)** causes net deactivation of the ring, while the electron-releasing **Resonance Effect (+M)** operates specifically at the _ortho_ and _para_ positions, controlling the orientation of the incoming electrophile.
3. **Reaction with Metals:**
    - **Fittig Reaction:** Two aryl halides react with sodium in dry ether to form a compound where two aryl groups join (e.g., biphenyl).
    - **Wurtz-Fittig Reaction:** An alkyl halide and an aryl halide react with sodium in dry ether to form an alkylarene.

### **VII. Polyhalogen Compounds (Theoretical/Uses)**

Review the uses and environmental implications of key polyhalogen compounds (e.g., Dichloromethane, Chloroform, CCl4, Iodoform, Freons, DDT).

**Analogy for $S_N1$ vs. $S_N2$ Reactivity:**

Understanding the reactivity order for $S_N1$ and $S_N2$ is like planning a birthday party based on the nature of the guests:

- **$S_N1$ (Carbocation Stability):** The party is successful if the central "Carbocation" guest is highly stable, well-supported, and popular. **$3^\circ$ (Tertiary) halides** are the most stable and thus the fastest in $S_N1$.
- **$S_N2$ (Steric Hindrance):** The new "Nucleophile" guest must physically approach the central carbon. The faster the reaction, the less crowded the path. **Methyl halides** have the least crowding (minimal "Bodyguards") and are the fastest in $S_N2$.
