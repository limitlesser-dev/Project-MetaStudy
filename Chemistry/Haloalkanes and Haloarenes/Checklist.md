This checklist is designed based on the objectives and sectional content provided in the Unit on Haloalkanes and Haloarenes, ensuring primary emphasis on the details and classifications presented in the source material.

### Unit Checklist: Haloalkanes and Haloarenes

#### I. Introduction and Classification

- **Define and differentiate** Haloalkane (Alkyl halide) and Haloarene (Aryl halide):
    - Haloalkanes: Halogen atom(s) attached to $sp^3$ hybridised carbon of an alkyl group.
    - Haloarenes: Halogen atom(s) attached to $sp^2$ hybridised carbon atom(s) of an aryl group.
- **Classification based on the number of halogen atoms:** Mono-, di-, or polyhalogen compounds.
- **Classification of compounds containing $sp^3$ C—X Bond (6.1.2):**
    - Alkyl halides (R—X): Classified as primary (1°), secondary (2°), or tertiary (3°) based on the nature of the carbon atom attached to the halogen.
    - Allylic halides: Halogen bonded to an $sp^3$-hybridised carbon adjacent to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).
    - Benzylic halides: Halogen bonded to an $sp^3$-hybridised carbon atom attached to an aromatic ring.
- **Classification of compounds containing $sp^2$ C—X Bond (6.1.3):**
    - Vinylic halides: Halogen bonded directly to an $sp^2$-hybridised carbon atom of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).
    - Aryl halides: Halogen directly bonded to the $sp^2$-hybridised carbon atom of an aromatic ring.
- **Dihaloalkanes nomenclature:**
    - Geminal halides (gem-dihalides): Halogen atoms on the same carbon.
    - Vicinal halides (vic-dihalides): Halogen atoms on adjacent carbon atoms.

#### II. Nomenclature (6.2)

- **Apply IUPAC system** for naming haloalkanes (halosubstituted hydrocarbons) and haloarenes.
- **Determine Common Names** for alkyl halides (alkyl group followed by halide name).
- **Use prefixes** _o-_, _m-_, _p-_ in the common system or numerals (1,2; 1,3; 1,4) in the IUPAC system for dihalogen derivatives of benzene.

#### III. Nature of C–X Bond (6.3)

- **Understand the polarity** of the carbon-halogen bond (C—X) due to the higher electronegativity of the halogen atom (C bears partial positive charge, X bears partial negative charge).
- **Correlate** the size of the halogen atom with C—X bond length (increases from C—F to C—I).
- **Identify trends** in bond length, bond enthalpy, and dipole moment for methyl halides (Table 6.2).

#### IV. Methods of Preparation (6.4 & 6.5)

- **Haloalkanes (6.4):**
    - From Alcohols (6.4.1): Replacement of –OH with halogen using concentrated halogen acids, phosphorus halides, or thionyl chloride ($\text{SOCl}_2$). Know why thionyl chloride is preferred. Know the reactivity order of alcohols (3° > 2° > 1°).
    - From Hydrocarbons (6.4.2): Free radical halogenation (yields a complex mixture); Addition of hydrogen halides to alkenes (follows Markovnikov’s rule); Addition of halogens to alkenes (forms vic-dibromides).
    - Halogen Exchange (6.4.3): Finkelstein reaction (for alkyl iodides using NaI in dry acetone). Swarts reaction (for alkyl fluorides using metallic fluorides like AgF).
- **Haloarenes (6.5):**
    - From hydrocarbons by electrophilic substitution (using Lewis acids like $\text{FeCl}_3$).
    - Sandmeyer’s reaction: From primary aromatic amines via diazonium salts (replacement by –Cl or –Br using cuprous halides). Replacement by iodine requires shaking with KI.

#### V. Physical Properties (6.6)

- **Melting and Boiling points:**
    - Understand why halogen derivatives have significantly higher boiling points than parent hydrocarbons (stronger dipole-dipole and van der Waals forces).
    - Know the boiling point trend for the same alkyl group: RI > RBr > RCl > RF.
    - Understand the effect of branching (boiling points decrease with increased branching).
    - Recall that _para_-isomers of dihalobenzenes have higher melting points due to symmetry.
- **Solubility:** Recognize that haloalkanes are only slightly soluble in water but dissolve readily in organic solvents.
- **Density:** Bromo, iodo, and polychloro derivatives are generally heavier than water.

#### VI. Chemical Reactions of Haloalkanes (6.7.1)

- **Identify the three main reaction categories:** Nucleophilic substitution, Elimination reactions, and Reaction with metals.
- **Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions:**
    - Define Nucleophile and Nucleophilic Substitution.
    - Recall common nucleophiles and their resulting products (e.g., $\text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{Alcohol}$, $\text{KCN} \rightarrow \text{Nitrile}$) (Table 6.4).
    - Identify and explain **Ambident Nucleophiles** (e.g., cyanide $\text{CN}^-$, nitrite $\text{NO}_2^-$). Know why KCN yields alkyl cyanides while AgCN yields isocyanides.
    - **$\text{S}_{\text{N}}2$ Mechanism (Bimolecular):** Understand the single-step mechanism, second-order kinetics, and the formation of the transition state (five atoms bonded to C). Know that $\text{S}_{\text{N}}2$ is accompanied by **inversion of configuration**. Reactivity order: Methyl halide > $1^\circ > 2^\circ > 3^\circ$ (due to steric hindrance).
    - **$\text{S}_{\text{N}}1$ Mechanism (Unimolecular):** Understand the two-step mechanism, first-order kinetics, and the slow formation of a planar carbocation intermediate. Know that $\text{S}_{\text{N}}1$ is accompanied by **racemisation** (attack from either side of the planar carbocation). Reactivity order: $3^\circ > 2^\circ > 1^\circ$ (due to carbocation stability).
    - **Effect of Leaving Group:** Reactivity R–I > R–Br > R–Cl >> R–F for both $\text{S}_{\text{N}}1$ and $\text{S}_{\text{N}}2$.
    - **Stereochemistry:** Define and recognize Optical activity, Chirality, Enantiomers, Racemic mixtures, Retention, and Inversion.
- **Elimination Reactions ($\beta$-Elimination):** Understand that heating haloalkanes with alcoholic KOH results in elimination of $\text{HX}$ to form an alkene. Apply **Zaitsev’s rule** to predict the major alkene product (alkene with the greater number of alkyl groups attached to the doubly bonded carbon atoms).
- **Competition:** Understand that substitution and elimination compete, and the route taken depends on the nature of the halide, strength/size of the base/nucleophile, and reaction conditions.
- **Reaction with Metals:** Know how to prepare **Grignard Reagents** ($\text{RMgX}$) using $\text{Mg}$ in dry ether. Understand the importance of anhydrous conditions. Know the **Wurtz reaction** (alkyl halides + $\text{Na}$ in dry ether) for coupling.

#### VII. Chemical Reactions of Haloarenes (6.7.2)

- **Nucleophilic Substitution:** Know the reasons for the extreme lack of reactivity compared to haloalkanes (Resonance partial double bond character, $sp^2$ hybridisation of C, instability of phenyl cation, repulsion).
- **Effect of Electron Withdrawing Groups:** Understand that electron withdrawing groups (e.g., $-\text{NO}_2$) at _ortho_- and _para_-positions increase reactivity by stabilising the carbanion intermediate through resonance.
- **Electrophilic Substitution Reactions:** Know that haloarenes undergo Halogenation, Nitration, Sulphonation, and Friedel-Crafts reactions. Recognize that the halogen is _o, p_-directing but deactivating (Inductive effect stronger than Resonance).
- **Reaction with Metals:** Know the **Wurtz-Fittig reaction** (alkyl halide + aryl halide + Na) and the **Fittig reaction** (aryl halide + aryl halide + Na).

#### VIII. Polyhalogen Compounds (6.8)

- **Dichloromethane ($\text{CH}_2\text{Cl}_2$):** Uses (solvent, paint remover) and effects (harms CNS).
- **Chloroform ($\text{CHCl}_3$):** Uses (solvent, Freon R-22 production), replacement as an anaesthetic, effects (CNS depressant, liver/kidney damage). Storage: Must be kept in closed dark coloured bottles to prevent oxidation to poisonous phosgene ($\text{COCl}_2$).
- **Iodoform ($\text{CHI}_3$):** Previously used as an antiseptic (activity due to free iodine).
- **Carbon Tetrachloride ($\text{CCl}_4$):** Uses (refrigerants, solvent), severe health effects (liver cancer, CNS damage), and environmental effect (depletes the ozone layer).
- **Freons ($\text{CCl}_2\text{F}_2$):** Properties (stable, non-toxic, non-corrosive) and use (refrigeration, aerosol propellants). Know their role in initiating radical chain reactions that upset the natural ozone balance in the stratosphere.
- **DDT:** Uses (insecticide, effective against mosquitoes), problems (insect resistance, high toxicity to fish), and consequence of stability and fat solubility (bioaccumulation).

#### IX. Review and Application

- **Solve problems** involving the preparation and structural classification of isomers (e.g., $\text{C}_5\text{H}_{11}\text{Br}$).

- **Apply Zaitsev’s rule** to predict major elimination products.
- **Understand and explain** key concepts (e.g., why $p$-dichlorobenzene has a higher melting point, why Grignard reagents need anhydrous conditions, or why haloarenes are $o, p$-directing despite deactivation).
- **Complete the exercises** provided in the unit.
