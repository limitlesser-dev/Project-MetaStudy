The big picture of the unit "Haloalkanes and Haloarenes" is a systematic study of organic compounds containing carbon-halogen bonds, encompassing their structure, preparation, physical properties, and, most importantly, their distinctive reaction mechanisms. The chapter is designed to provide a comprehensive foundation by addressing three primary areas: the chemistry of $sp^3$ bonded halogens (Haloalkanes), the chemistry of $sp^2$ bonded halogens (Haloarenes), and the required stereochemical principles necessary for understanding their mechanisms.

The unit progresses through the following key phases:

### **Phase I: Definition and Structural Classification (The Foundation)**

The unit establishes the two main classes based on the hybridization of the carbon atom bonded to the halogen:

1. **Haloalkanes (Alkyl Halides):** These contain the halogen atom(s) attached to an **$sp^3$ hybridised carbon** atom of an alkyl group. This class is further sub-classified into primary (1°), secondary (2°), and tertiary (3°) based on the carbon nature. Specific structural types include **Allylic halides** (halogen on $sp^3$ adjacent to a $\text{C}=\text{C}$ bond) and **Benzylic halides** (halogen on $sp^3$ attached to an aromatic ring).
2. **Haloarenes (Aryl Halides):** These contain the halogen atom(s) attached directly to the **$sp^2$ hybridised carbon** atom(s) of an aryl group. This classification also covers **Vinylic halides** (halogen bonded to an $sp^2$ carbon of a $\text{C}=\text{C}$ double bond).
3. **Nomenclature:** Compounds are classified by the number of halogens (mono, di, poly). The primary system used is **IUPAC nomenclature**. Dihalogen compounds are further classified as **geminal** (halogens on the same carbon) or **vicinal** (halogens on adjacent carbons).

### **Phase II: Physical Properties and Bond Polarity**

This section deals with the physical consequences of introducing a highly electronegative halogen atom:

- **Polarity:** The carbon-halogen ($\text{C}—\text{X}$) bond is **polar** because the halogen atom is more electronegative than carbon, leading to a partial positive charge on carbon.
- **Boiling Points (B.P.):** Haloalkanes generally have **considerably higher boiling points** than their parent hydrocarbons due to stronger intermolecular forces of attraction, specifically dipole-dipole interactions and van der Waals forces. B.P. decreases with increasing size/mass of the halogen ($\text{RI} > \text{RBr} > \text{RCl} > \text{RF}$) and decreases with increasing branching of the alkyl chain.
- **Melting Points:** **Para-isomers** of dihalobenzenes are noted for having higher melting points compared to _ortho_- and _meta_-isomers due to the symmetry of the _para_-isomer, which allows for better fitting into the crystal lattice.
- **Solubility:** Haloalkanes are **very slightly soluble in water** because the weak attractions formed with water molecules do not release enough energy to overcome the hydrogen bonds between water molecules. However, they are soluble in organic solvents.

### **Phase III: Stereochemistry and Reaction Mechanisms**

This crucial phase applies stereochemistry as a tool for understanding how haloalkanes react.

- **Optical Activity and Chirality:** A molecule is **chiral** if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, typically containing an **asymmetric carbon** (or stereocenter) bonded to four different atoms or groups. Chiral molecules are **optically active**, meaning they rotate plane-polarized light (either dextrorotatory (+) or laevo-rotatory (–)).
- **Enantiomers:** Stereoisomers that are **non-superimposable mirror images**.
- **Racemic Mixture:** An equimolar mixture of two enantiomers, resulting in **zero optical rotation** (optically inactive).
- **Nucleophilic Substitution ($\mathbf{S}_{\text{N}}2$):** A **bimolecular**, single-step reaction where the rate depends on both reactants. Steric hindrance is critical, favoring methyl and primary halides. The reaction involves the nucleophile attacking from the back, leading to **inversion of configuration** (Walden inversion).
- **Nucleophilic Substitution ($\mathbf{S}_{\text{N}}1$):** A **unimolecular**, two-step reaction in polar protic solvents, proceeding via a **carbocation intermediate**. The rate depends on carbocation stability ($3^\circ > 2^\circ > 1^\circ$). Since the intermediate is planar, attack can occur from either side, resulting in **racemisation**.
- **Ambident Nucleophiles:** Species like the cyanide ion possess two nucleophilic centers. The product depends on whether the attacking reagent ($\text{KCN}$ vs $\text{AgCN}$) is ionic or covalent.

### **Phase IV: Chemical Reactivity (Haloalkanes vs. Haloarenes)**

This section contrasts the primary reaction types of the two classes:

#### **A. Haloalkane Reactions**

1. **Elimination ($\beta$-Elimination):** Haloalkanes react with alcoholic $\text{KOH}$ to eliminate $\text{H}$ and $\text{X}$, forming an alkene. When multiple products are possible, the major product is the **more substituted alkene** according to **Saytzeff’s Rule**.
2. **Reaction with Metals:** Formation of **Grignard Reagents ($\text{RMgX}$)** using $\text{Mg}$ in **dry ether**. These reagents are highly reactive and must be kept anhydrous as they react rapidly with protons (from water, alcohol, etc.) to form hydrocarbons. The **Wurtz reaction** couples two alkyl halides using sodium in dry ether to form a hydrocarbon with a doubled carbon chain.

#### **B. Haloarene Reactions**

1. **Nucleophilic Substitution Reactivity:** Aryl halides are **extremely less reactive** toward nucleophilic substitution reactions. This reduced reactivity is attributed to **resonance effect** (giving the $\text{C}—\text{X}$ bond partial double bond character), the greater electronegativity of the $sp^2$ carbon, and the instability of the phenyl cation required for $\text{S}_{\text{N}}1$.
    - Reactivity increases significantly if **electron-withdrawing groups** (like $-\text{NO}_2$) are present at the _ortho_ and _para_ positions.
2. **Electrophilic Substitution Reactions:** Haloarenes undergo typical aromatic substitution. The halogen atom is **$o, p$-directing** (due to resonance) but is **deactivating** (due to the stronger $-\text{I}$ effect withdrawing electrons from the ring).
3. **Reaction with Metals:** Includes the **Wurtz-Fittig reaction** (coupling an alkyl halide and an aryl halide) and the **Fittig reaction** (coupling two aryl halides).

### **Phase V: Applications and Environmental Concerns**

The unit concludes by fulfilling the objective of highlighting the environmental effects and uses of important organohalogen compounds.

- This section discusses **Polyhalogen Compounds**, including Dichloromethane, Chloroform (which oxidizes to the poisonous gas **phosgene** in light), Iodoform, Carbon Tetrachloride (an ozone layer depleter), Freons (aerosol propellants), and **DDT** (the widely used insecticide, which persists in the environment due to its resistance to breakdown).
