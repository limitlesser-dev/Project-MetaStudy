The roadmap for this chapter, titled "The d- and f- Block Elements," outlines the study of transition metals (d-block) and inner transition metals (f-block), covering their positions, electronic structures, general characteristics, important compounds, and applications.

The chapter is structured around the following key sections and sub-sections:

### **I. Objectives**

The unit aims for you to be able to:

- Learn the positions of the d– and f-block elements in the periodic table.
- Know the electronic configurations of the transition (d-block) and the inner transition (f-block) elements.
- Appreciate the relative stability of various oxidation states in terms of electrode potential values.
- Describe the general characteristics and trends (horizontal and group) of the d– and f–block elements.
- Describe the preparation, properties, structures, and uses of some important compounds, such as $\text{K}_2\text{Cr}_2\text{O}_7$ and $\text{KMnO}_4$.
- Describe the properties of the f-block elements and give a comparative account of the lanthanoids and actinoids.

### **II. The Transition Elements (d-Block)**

This section deals with the d-block elements, which occupy the large middle section of the periodic table between the s– and p– blocks.

#### **4.1 Position in the Periodic Table**

- Identifying the four series of transition metals (3d, 4d, 5d, and 6d).

#### **4.2 Electronic Configurations of the d-Block Elements**

- Understanding the general outer electronic configuration $(n-1)d^{1–10} ns^{1–2}$ (with exceptions like $\text{Pd}$).
- Analyzing exceptions to the general configuration, such as $\text{Cr}$ ($3d^5 4s^1$) and $\text{Cu}$ ($3d^{10} 4s^1$).

#### **4.3 General Properties of the Transition Elements (d-Block)**

This major section focuses primarily on the properties and trends of the first row (3d) transition metals:

- **4.3.1 Physical Properties:** Discussing typical metallic properties (high tensile strength, ductility, metallic lustre) and high melting/boiling points attributed to metallic bonding involving $(n-1)d$ electrons.
- **4.3.2 Variation in Atomic and Ionic Sizes:** Examining the progressive decrease in radius with increasing atomic number and the role of **Lanthanoid contraction** in making the $4d$ and $5d$ series elements exhibit similar radii.
- **4.3.3 Ionisation Enthalpies:** Discussing the irregular trends in successive ionization enthalpies and stability related to half-filled ($d^5$) and completely filled ($d^{10}$) orbitals.
- **4.3.4 Oxidation States:** Noting the great variety of oxidation states (especially in the middle of the series, like $\text{Mn}$ exhibiting $+2$ to $+7$). This section also covers the stabilization of higher oxidation states in heavier members of a group.
- **4.3.5 Trends in the $M^{2+}/M$ Standard Electrode Potentials:** Exploring the correlation between $E^\circ$ values and ionisation enthalpies and the unique positive value for $\text{Cu}$.
- **4.3.6 Trends in the $M^{3+}/M^{2+}$ Standard Electrode Potentials:** Analyzing variations related to the stability of $\text{Sc}^{3+}$ (noble gas configuration), $\text{Mn}^{2+}$ ($d^5$), and $\text{Fe}^{3+}$ ($d^5$).
- **4.3.7 Trends in Stability of Higher Oxidation States:** Focusing on the ability of fluorine and oxygen to stabilize high oxidation states, culminating in oxides like $\text{Mn}_2\text{O}_7$.
- **4.3.8 Chemical Reactivity and $E^\circ$ Values:** Examining the reactivity of the metals, generally electropositive but sometimes passive, and identifying strong reducing agents ($\text{Ti}^{2+}$, $\text{V}^{2+}$, $\text{Cr}^{2+}$) and strong oxidising agents ($\text{Mn}^{3+}$, $\text{Co}^{3+}$).
- **4.3.9 Magnetic Properties:** Discussing diamagnetism, paramagnetism, and ferromagnetism, focusing on calculating magnetic moment using the **‘spin-only’ formula** based on unpaired electrons.
- **4.3.10 Formation of Coloured Ions:** Explaining colour formation due to electron excitation between $d$ orbitals (discussed further in Unit 5).
- **4.3.11 Formation of Complex Compounds:** Explaining the formation of a large number of complexes due to small ion size, high ionic charge, and availability of $d$ orbitals.
- **4.3.12 Catalytic Properties:** Ascribing catalytic activity to the ability to adopt multiple oxidation states and form complexes.
- **4.3.13 Formation of Interstitial Compounds:** Describing the non-stoichiometric compounds formed when small atoms are trapped in metal lattices, leading to increased hardness and high melting points.
- **4.3.14 Alloy Formation:** Discussing the readiness of transition metals to form alloys due to similar radii and characteristics.

### **III. Some Important Compounds of Transition Elements**

#### **4.4.1 Oxides and Oxoanions of Metals**

- **General Oxide Characteristics:** Noting that ionic character decreases and acidic character increases as the oxidation number of the metal increases (e.g., $\text{V}_2\text{O}_3$ is basic, $\text{V}_2\text{O}_5$ is amphoteric).
- **Potassium Dichromate ($\text{K}_2\text{Cr}_2\text{O}_7$):** Detailing its preparation from chromite ore and its strong oxidising action in acidic solution.
- **Potassium Permanganate ($\text{KMnO}_4$):** Describing its preparation from $\text{MnO}_2$ and its intense colour and strong oxidising reactions in acid, neutral, or faintly alkaline solutions.

### **IV. The Inner Transition Elements (f-Block)**

This section covers the lanthanoids and actinoids, placed in a separate panel at the bottom of the periodic table.

#### **4.5 The Lanthanoids**

- **4.5.1 Electronic Configurations:** Focusing on the $\text{La}^{3+}$ and $\text{Ln}^{3+}$ ions having the stable form $4f^n$.
- **4.5.2 Atomic and Ionic Sizes:** Analyzing the **lanthanoid contraction**—the overall decrease in radii from lanthanum to lutetium—and its impact on the radii of succeeding $5d$ elements.
- **4.5.3 Oxidation States:** Noting that $\text{Ln}(\text{III})$ is predominant, with occasional $+2$ and $+4$ states arising from the stability of $f^0$, $f^7$, or $f^{14}$ configurations (e.g., $\text{Ce}^{\text{IV}}$ and $\text{Eu}^{2+}$).
- **4.5.4 General Characteristics:** Discussing their reactivity (similar to calcium in earlier members), metallic structure, and their general reactions, including forming oxides $\text{M}_2\text{O}_3$ and basic hydroxides $\text{M}(\text{OH})_3$.

#### **4.6 The Actinoids**

- **4.6.1 Electronic Configurations:** Noting that electrons are formally added to $5f$ orbitals, with irregularities related to the stabilities of $f^0$, $f^7$, and $f^{14}$ occupancies.
- **4.6.2 Ionic Sizes:** Discussing the **actinoid contraction**, which is greater from element to element than the lanthanoid contraction due to poorer shielding by $5f$ electrons.
- **4.6.3 Oxidation States:** Highlighting the greater range and complexity of oxidation states (up to $+7$ in $\text{Np}$), attributed to the comparable energies of $5f$, $6d$, and $7s$ levels, though $+3$ is still the general oxidation state.
- **4.6.4 General Characteristics and Comparison with Lanthanoids:** Observing that actinoids are highly reactive, radioactive, and have lower ionisation enthalpies than early lanthanoids.

### **V. Some Applications of d- and f-Block Elements**

This final section covers practical applications, including:

- The use of $\text{Fe}$ and steels in construction.
- Industrial metals like $\text{Ti}$ ($\text{TiO}_2$ pigment) and $\text{Mn}$ ($\text{MnO}_2$ in batteries).
- Coinage metals ($\text{Ag}$, $\text{Au}$, $\text{Cu}$).
- Catalysts like $\text{V}_2\text{O}_5$ (Sulphuric acid manufacture), $\text{Fe}$ (Haber process), and $\text{Ni}$ (hydrogenation).
- The use of lanthanoid alloys, notably **mischmetall** (used for bullets, shell, and lighter flint).
