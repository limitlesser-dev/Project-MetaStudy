This chapter, **Solutions**, focuses on homogeneous mixtures and their properties, especially how adding a solute affects the solvent. Below is the chapter structured as a series of questions and answers to help you learn the core concepts:

---

## I. Mixtures and Solutions Basics

### Q: What is a mixture, and does it have a fixed composition?

A: A **Mixture** is formed when two or more chemically non-reactive substances are physically mixed together. Most materials around us are mixtures (e.g., air, blood, alloys, mineral water). A key characteristic of a mixture is that it does not have a fixed ratio or fixed composition.

### Q: How are mixtures broadly classified, and what is a True Solution?

A: Mixtures are broadly classified as **Homogeneous** (uniform composition, components not individually visible, single phase, e.g., salt + water, alloys) or **Heterogeneous** (non-uniform composition, components individually visible, multiple phases, e.g., oil + water, sand + water).

In नाइंथ क्लास (Ninth Grade), mixtures were further divided into Solutions, Suspensions, and Colloids based on particle size. **Solutions (True Solutions)** are homogeneous mixtures where the particle size is very small, less than 1 nanometer (or $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-8}$ cm).

### Q: What are the components of a solution typically called?

A: Every solution has two main components:

1. **Solvent (A):** Generally, the component present in a greater amount, or the substance that dissolves the other component.
2. **Solute (B):** Generally, the component present in a lesser amount, or the substance that gets dissolved (e.g., sugar is the solute, water is the solvent).

## II. Concentration of Solutions (Revision)

Concentration generally describes how much solute (B) is present in the solution.

### Q: How is Mass Percentage calculated?[^1]

A: Mass Percentage is calculated as: $$\text{Mass Percentage} = \frac{\text{Mass of Solute} (W_B)}{\text{Mass of Solution} (W_A + W_B)} \times 100$$ 

### Q: When do we use Parts Per Million (PPM), and how is it related to mass percentage?

A: Parts Per Million (PPM) is used when concentrations are very small, such as pollution in the air or traces of pesticides. Instead of calculating the amount per hundred (percentage), we calculate the amount per million ($10^6$). $$\text{PPM} = \frac{\text{Mass of Solute}}{\text{Mass of Solution}} \times 10^6$$ PPM is related to Mass Percentage by the formula: $\text{PPM} = \text{Mass Percentage} \times 10^4$.

### Q: Define Mole Fraction ($X$) and state the sum rule.

A: **Mole Fraction** is the fraction of moles of a specific component relative to the total number of moles in the solution. For solute B: $$X_B = \frac{n_B}{n_A + n_B}$$ The sum of the mole fractions of all components in a solution is always one ($X_A + X_B = 1$).

### Q: Define Molarity (M) and Molality (m), and explain why Molality is preferred in this chapter.

A:

| Term             | Definition                                                               | Formula (Symbolic)                                           | Unit           |
| :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------- |
| **Molarity (M)** | Moles of solute divided by the **Volume of the Solution** in **Liters**. | $$M = \frac{n_B}{V_{A+B}} = \frac{W_B}{M_B \times V_{A+B}}$$ | mol/L (Molar)  |
| **Molality (m)** | Moles of solute divided by the **Mass of the Solvent** in **Kilograms**. | $$m = \frac{n_B}{W_A} = \frac{W_B}{M_B \times W_A}$$         | mol/kg (Molal) |

Molality is preferred in this chapter (especially for colligative properties) because it involves mass of solvent (or moles and mass), which does ==**not change with temperature**==, unlike the volume used in Molarity.

## III. Colligative Properties

### Q: What are Colligative Properties?

A: **Colligative Properties** are those properties of a solution that depend ==**only on the number (amount) of solute particles**== present, irrespective of the chemical nature of the solute. Since we initially study these properties for solutes that do not [^2]dissociate or associate in the solvent, we focus on [^3]**non-electrolytes**.

### Q: What is Relative Lowering of Vapor Pressure (RLVP)?

A: When a [^4]**non-volatile solute** is added to a volatile solvent, the solute particles occupy the surface, hindering the solvent's ability to form vapors. This causes the vapor pressure of the solution ($P$) to be **lower** than that of the pure solvent ($P^0$).

- **Lowering of Vapor Pressure:** $P^0 - P$.
- **Relative Lowering of Vapor Pressure (RLVP):** The lowering divided by the original pressure:[^5] $$\frac{P^0 - P}{P^0}$$.

### Q: State the formula for Relative Lowering of Vapor Pressure (RLVP) based on Raoult's Law.

A: RLVP is directly proportional to the mole fraction of the solute ($X_B$): $$\text{RLVP} = \frac{P^0 - P}{P^0} = X_B = \frac{n_B}{n_A + n_B}$$

### Q: What is the true definition of boiling?

A: Boiling occurs when the **vapor pressure of the liquid equals the atmospheric pressure**. Water boils at $100^{\circ}\text{C}$ only when the surrounding atmospheric pressure is 1 ATM.

### Q: Why does the boiling point increase (elevate) when a non-volatile solute is added?

A: When a non-volatile solute is added, the solution's vapor pressure decreases (RLVP occurs). To make this lowered vapor pressure reach the atmospheric pressure (and thus boil), the solution requires a **higher temperature ($T_2$)** than the pure solvent ($T_1$). This increase is the **Elevation in Boiling Point ($\Delta T_b$)**.

### Q: State the mathematical formula for Elevation in Boiling Point ($\Delta T_b$) and define the constant used.

A: The elevation in boiling point ($\Delta T_b$) is directly proportional to the molality ($m$) of the solution. $$\Delta T_b = T_2 - T_1$$ $$\Delta T_b = K_b \cdot m$$ Where $K_b$ is the **Elevation Constant** (or Ebullioscopic Constant). Its unit is Kelvin $\text{kg}$ per $\text{mol}$. The expanded formula is: $$\Delta T_b = K_b \frac{W_B}{M_B \times W_A}$$ (Where $W_A$ must be in kg).

### Q: Why does the freezing point decrease (depress) when a solute is added?

A: Adding a solute causes **Depression in Freezing Point ($\Delta T_f$)**. The solute particles interfere with the ability of the solvent molecules to properly align and form a solid crystal lattice (freezing). Since freezing becomes difficult, a **lower temperature ($T_2$)** is required to solidify the solution compared to the pure solvent ($T_1$).

### Q: State the mathematical formula for Depression in Freezing Point ($\Delta T_f$), including how $\Delta T_f$ is calculated from $T_1$ and $T_2$.

A: Since the pure solvent's freezing point ($T_1$) is higher than the solution's freezing point ($T_2$), the depression is calculated as: $$\Delta T_f = T_1 - T_2$$ $\Delta T_f$ is directly proportional to the molality ($m$): $$\Delta T_f = K_f \cdot m$$ $K_f$ is the **Depression Constant** (or Cryoscopic Constant), and its unit is Kelvin $\text{kg}$ per $\text{mol}$. The expanded formula is: $$\Delta T_f = K_f \frac{W_B}{M_B \times W_A}$$ (Where $W_A$ must be in kg).

### Q: Give two applications of Depression in Freezing Point.

A: Applications include:

1. **To melt ice fast:** Adding salt (like common salt) to ice lowers its freezing point, causing it to melt more quickly.
2. **Anti-freezing solutions and coolants for cars:** In cold environments, substances are added to liquids (like engine coolants) to lower their freezing point, preventing them from freezing when the temperature drops below $0^{\circ}\text{C}$.

### Q: Define Osmosis, specifying the direction of solvent movement.

A: **Osmosis** is the movement of solvent molecules (usually water) through a selectively permeable membrane (SPM). This movement occurs:

- From a region of **Higher concentration of Solvent** to a region of **Lower concentration of Solvent**.
- (Equivalently) From a region of **Lower concentration of Solute** to a region of **Higher concentration of Solute**.

### Q: Define Osmotic Pressure ($\Pi$).

A: **Osmotic Pressure ($\Pi$)** is the pressure that must be applied in the opposite direction to prevent (stop) osmosis from occurring.

### Q: State the main mathematical formulas for Osmotic Pressure.

A: Osmotic pressure ($\Pi$) is directly proportional to concentration ($C$) and temperature ($T$). The concentration used here is **Molarity (M)**. $$\Pi = C R T$$ Since Molarity $C = n/V$, the formula can be written similar to the Ideal Gas Law ($PV=nRT$): $$\Pi V = n R T$$ Where $R$ is the Gas Constant, typically taken as $0.083$ when volume ($V$) is in Liters and pressure ($\Pi$) is in bar.

### Q: What is Reverse Osmosis (RO) and how is it achieved?

A: Reverse Osmosis (RO) is the process used for water purification. Normally, water travels from the purer side (high solvent concentration) to the impure side (low solvent concentration). To achieve purification, an external pressure greater than the osmotic pressure ($P > \Pi$) must be applied to the impure side. This forces the solvent molecules to move back through the membrane from the impure side to the pure side, thus reversing the natural osmotic flow.

## IV. Solubility and Related Laws

### Q: Define Solubility.

A: **Solubility** is the **maximum amount of solute** that can be dissolved in a given amount of solvent at a specific temperature. It essentially represents the maximum concentration possible.

### Q: How does temperature affect the solubility of a solid in a liquid versus a gas in a liquid?

A:

- **Solid in Liquid:** Solubility is generally **directly proportional** to temperature. Increasing temperature increases the solubility of solids (e.g., sugar dissolves better in hot water).
- **Gas in Liquid:** Solubility is [^6]**inversely proportional** to temperature. Increasing temperature decreases the solubility of gases in liquids (e.g., cold drinks lose gas when warmed, aquatic life struggles in warm water due to low dissolved oxygen).

### Q: State the key principle of Henry's Law in its modified form.

A: Henry's Law describes the relationship between pressure and the solubility of a gas in a liquid. The modified statement is: The **partial pressure** of the gas ($P$) in the vapor phase is proportional to the **mole fraction** of the gas ($X$) in the solution. $$P = K_H \cdot X$$ Where $K_H$ is the **Henry's Constant**.

### Q: What is the relationship between Henry's Constant ($K_H$) and gas solubility?

A: Henry's Constant ($K_H$) is inversely proportional to solubility (represented by mole fraction $X$).

- A higher value of $K_H$ means lower gas solubility.
- Since gas solubility decreases as temperature increases, $K_H$ increases with temperature. For example, comparing Nitrogen and Oxygen at the same temperature, the gas with the smaller $K_H$ (Oxygen) is more soluble.

### Q: Give two applications of Henry's Law.

A:

1. **Carbonated Drinks:** Cold drinks and sodas are packed at high pressure because increasing pressure increases the solubility of $\text{CO}_2$ (the gas).
2. **Deep-Sea Diving (Bends Disease):** Deep-sea divers experience high pressure, causing typically insoluble gases like nitrogen (78% of air) to dissolve rapidly in their blood. To prevent the painful decompression sickness known as "bends," helium gas is mixed with the air in the tanks, replacing some nitrogen, as helium has a lower solubility.

### Q: State Raoult's Law for volatile liquids.

A: For a solution containing volatile liquids, the **partial vapor pressure** of each component ($P_A$) is directly proportional to its **mole fraction** ($X_A$) in the solution. $$P_A = P^0_A X_A$$ Where $P^0_A$ is the vapor pressure of component A in its pure state.

When combined with Dalton's Law of Partial Pressure ($P_{total} = P_A + P_B$), the total pressure over the solution is: $$P_{total} = P^0_A X_A + P^0_B X_B$$
[^7]
## V. Ideal and Non-Ideal Solutions

### Q: What is the definition of an Ideal Solution?

A: **Ideal Solutions** are solutions that exactly follow **Raoult's Law**. For an ideal solution:

1. $P_{total} = P_A + P_B$.
2. Mixing results in **No change in [^8]Enthalpy** ($\Delta H_{mix} = 0$).
3. Mixing results in **No change in Volume** ($\Delta V_{mix} = 0$).
4. There are no attraction or repulsion forces between the solute (B) and solvent (A) components.

### Q: Describe the differences in enthalpy ($\Delta H_{mix}$) and volume ($\Delta V_{mix}$) for Non-Ideal Solutions showing positive and negative deviations.

A: **Non-Ideal Solutions** do not follow Raoult's Law ($P_{total} \neq P_A + P_B$).

| Feature                         | Positive Deviation                           | Negative Deviation                                 |
| :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| **Total Pressure**              | $P_{total} > P_A + P_B$ (Pressure increases) | $P_{total} < P_A + P_B$ (Pressure decreases)       |
| **Interactions**                | Repulsion (Nafarat/Hate) between components  | Attraction (Love/Strong forces) between components |
| **$\Delta H_{mix}$ (Enthalpy)** | Positive (Endothermic process)               | Negative (Exothermic process)                      |
| **$\Delta V_{mix}$ (Volume)**   | Positive (Volume expands/increases)          | Negative (Volume contracts/decreases)              |

### Q: What are Azeotropic Mixtures (Azeotropes)?

A: Azeotropic mixtures (Azeotropes) are mixtures of two liquids that, upon mixing, boil at a **constant temperature**. Since they boil constantly, their composition does not change upon distillation, making them impossible to separate by simple distillation. [^9]

### Q: Relate Positive/Negative Deviation to Maximum/Minimum Boiling Azeotropes.

A:

- **Minimum Boiling Azeotropes:** Formed by solutions showing **Positive Deviation**. In these solutions, boiling is easy because of repulsion (high pressure/low forces), resulting in a boiling point lower than either pure component.
- **Maximum Boiling Azeotropes:** Formed by solutions showing **Negative Deviation**. In these solutions, boiling is difficult because of strong attraction (low pressure/high forces), resulting in a boiling point higher than either pure component.

## VI. Van't Hoff Factor ($\iota$)

### Q: Why is the Van't Hoff Factor ($\iota$) necessary?

A: The colligative properties studied previously assumed the solute was a **non-electrolyte** (it did not break apart or join together in the solvent). The Van't Hoff Factor is introduced to account for solutes that are **electrolytes** and either **dissociate** (break apart, increasing particle count) or **associate** (join together, decreasing particle count).

### Q: State the definition and formula for the Van't Hoff Factor ($\iota$).

A: The Van't Hoff Factor ($\iota$, or Iota) is the ratio of the number of particles after dissociation or association to the number of particles before. $$\iota = \frac{\text{Number of particles after dissociation/association}}{\text{Number of particles before dissociation/association}}$$ _For non-electrolytes (like glucose), $\iota = 1$._

### Q: How are colligative property formulas modified when using the Van't Hoff Factor?

A: Since colligative properties depend on the number of particles, all colligative property formulas must be multiplied by $\iota$:

- $\Delta T_f = \iota K_f m$
- $\Delta T_b = \iota K_b m$
- $\Pi = \iota CRT$

### Q: How is $\iota$ calculated for strong electrolytes?

A: For **strong electrolytes** (which undergo complete dissociation), $\iota$ is simply equal to the total number of ions formed.

- Example: $\text{K}_2\text{SO}_4 \to 2\text{K}^+ + \text{SO}_4^{2-}$.
- Particles after dissociation = 3 (2 $\text{K}^+$ ions and 1 $\text{SO}_4^{2-}$ ion).
- Particles before dissociation = 1 ($\text{K}_2\text{SO}_4$ molecule).
- Therefore, $\iota = 3/1 = 3$.

### Q: How is the Van't Hoff Factor ($\iota$) related to the degree of dissociation ($\alpha$) for a weak electrolyte that breaks into two ions?

A: For weak electrolytes, dissociation is partial, governed by the degree of dissociation ($\alpha$). For an electrolyte that dissociates into two ions (like $\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}$ into $\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-$ and $\text{H}^+$), the Van't Hoff Factor is related to $\alpha$ by the formula: $$\iota = 1 + \alpha$$

This $\alpha$ can be linked to the dissociation constant ($K_A$) and the solution's concentration ($C$) using the equilibrium formula: $$K_A = \frac{C\alpha^2}{1 - \alpha}$$.The previous response provided a comprehensive lesson plan structured as questions and answers covering all major topics in the **Solutions** chapter, concluding with the complex application of the Van't Hoff Factor ($\iota$) and dissociation constant ($K_A$).

The continuation below addresses the final phase of the lecture: the conclusion of the most complex numerical topic, the homework assignment, and the future plans for the lecture series.

## VII. Conclusion of Advanced Concepts (Van't Hoff Factor and Dissociation)

### Q: What complex calculation method was demonstrated using the Van't Hoff Factor ($\iota$) and the Dissociation Constant ($K_A$)?

A: The final calculation demonstrated how to link the dissociation constant ($K_A$) of a weak electrolyte to a colligative property, such as Depression in Freezing Point ($\Delta T_f$). The necessary steps are:

1. **Find the Degree of Dissociation ($\alpha$):** Use the formula for the dissociation constant, $K_A = C\alpha^2 / (1 - \alpha)$, to calculate $\alpha$. $C$ represents the concentration (Molarity or Molality). It is usually necessary to ignore the $1 - \alpha$ term in the denominator to simplify the calculation, otherwise, a quadratic equation would result.
2. **Find the Van't Hoff Factor ($\iota$):** Use the formula $\iota = 1 + \alpha$ (assuming the electrolyte breaks into two ions).
3. **Calculate the Colligative Property:** Finally, use the modified colligative property formula, such as $\Delta T_f = \iota K_f M$, to find the required value.

### Q: What homework task was assigned based on the final complex problem?

A: The homework task involves solving the problem in reverse. If the student is given the Depression in Freezing Point ($\Delta T_f$), they must use that value, along with $K_f$ and concentration, to calculate the Van't Hoff factor ($\iota$). Once $\iota$ is found, they must use $\iota = 1 + \alpha$ to find $\alpha$, and then use $\alpha$ in the equilibrium formula, $K_A = C\alpha^2 / (1 - \alpha)$, to determine the dissociation constant ($K_A$).

## VIII. Wrap-up and Future Plans

### Q: How did the instructor conclude the lesson, and what is the plan for future lectures?

A: The instructor celebrated the completion of the first Class 12 Chemistry one-shot on the channel, noting that it focused heavily on **NCERT questions** rather than pure Competency Based Questions (CBQs).

The immediate plan is to conduct the next one-shot lecture based on student feedback. The choices presented for the next chapter were **Electrochemistry** or the organic chapter, **Haloalkanes/Haloarenes**.

Following the completion of the next chapter, the instructor plans to release a dedicated lecture specifically for **Competency Based Questions** (CBQs), covering both the Solutions chapter and the subsequent chapter chosen by the students.

### Q: Where can students access lecture materials and additional resources?

A: The lecture slides (PPT) will be uploaded to the **"Ashu Ghai 11th & 12th" Telegram channel** shortly after the completion of the one-shot video.

For students interested in further resources:

- They can use the coupon code **RESULT 10** to receive a 10% discount on the paid batches.
- Students who want to practice many more Competency Based Questions beyond the free content can purchase the **Winner Series**.

# Notes from me for u 

[^1]: #### just remember that when you gets confused on what to use mass or weight just know that the mass is used when in like scientific calculation when you actually precise numbers because mass can't be changed but weight can be because weight depends on gravitational force of planets so just remember this prefer using mass more than weight

[^2]: ## **Association** means joining together. It happens when small particles (like molecules or ions) **combine to make bigger groups**.
	
	**Dissociation** means breaking apart. It happens when a big group (like a molecule or a salt) **splits into smaller parts** (like separate ions or molecules).
	
	**Simply:**
	
	- **Association:** Small things join to make something bigger.
	    
	- **Dissociation:** A big thing breaks into smaller pieces.
	    
	
	Example:
	
	- Table salt in water: It **dissociates** into sodium (Na⁺) and chloride (Cl⁻) ions.
	    
	- Some acids in oil: They may **associate** (join) to form pairs.

[^3]: **Non-electrolytes** are substances that **do not break into ions when dissolved in water**. Because they do not make ions, they **do not conduct electricity** in their solution.
	
	## In simple language:
	
	- **Non-electrolytes**: Things that dissolve in water, but **do not split into charged particles** (ions).
	    
	- Their solution **cannot conduct electricity**.
	    
	
	## Examples:
	
	- **Sugar** (like glucose or sucrose): Dissolves in water, but doesn’t form ions.
	    
	- **Alcohol** (like ethanol): Dissolves in water, but stays as neutral molecules.
	    
	- **Distilled water:** Pure water by itself is a very poor conductor because it has almost no ions.
	    
	
	## Difference from Electrolytes:
	
	- **Electrolytes** (like salt, acids, bases) **do split into ions** in water and **conduct electricity**.
	    
	
	**Tip:** If a substance doesn't make electricity pass through water, it's likely a non-electrolyte!

[^4]: **Volatile** substances are those that **easily turn into vapor or gas** at normal temperatures. They **evaporate quickly** and can often be smelled.
	
	**Non-volatile** substances are those that **do not easily become vapor or gas**. They **evaporate very slowly** or almost not at all.
	
	## In Easy Language:
	
	- **Volatile:** Changes from liquid to gas **quickly**.
	    
	- **Non-volatile:** **Stays as liquid or solid**, does **not easily change into gas**.
	    
	
	## Examples:
	
	- **Volatile:** Perfume, alcohol, petrol — you can smell them because they evaporate fast.
	    
	- **Non-volatile:** Water (evaporates slowly), sugar, salt, oil — these don’t turn into gas easily.
	    
	
	So, if something dries up fast, it's **volatile**. If it doesn’t dry up or go into air easily, it’s **non-volatile**.
	
	1. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw3C6_ZDDBo&t=305s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw3C6_ZDDBo&t=305s)

[^5]:  the RLVP formula, you are calculating **how much the vapour pressure of a solution drops** after adding a non-volatile solute to a solvent.

[^6]: When it comes to the **solubility of gases in liquids**, **temperature is inversely proportional** to solubility. That means:
	
	- **As temperature goes up, gas solubility goes down.**
	    
	- **As temperature goes down, gas solubility goes up.**
	    
	
	**Why does this happen?**
	
	- **Kinetic Energy:** When the temperature of the liquid increases, the molecules of both the gas and the liquid move faster (higher kinetic energy).
	    
	- **Escape Tendency:** The faster movement gives dissolved gas molecules enough energy to escape from the liquid back into the air.
	    
	- **Less Dissolving:** So, fewer gas molecules remain dissolved in the liquid.
	    
	
	**Example:**  
	If you heat a soda, you'll notice bubbles forming quickly—the dissolved carbon dioxide gas is escaping because the solubility drops at higher temperature.
	
	**Key Point:**  
	This is the opposite behavior compared to many solids dissolving in liquids, where higher temperature usually increases solubility.
	
	**Formula:**  
	This relation (for many gases) can be expressed as:
	
	C=kP⋅PC = k_P \cdot PC=kP⋅P
	
	- CCC: concentration of dissolved gas
	    
	- kPk_PkP: Henry’s law constant (depends on temperature; it gets lower at higher temperature)
	    
	- PPP: pressure of the gas
	    
	
	So, **higher temperature = lower Henry’s law constant = less gas dissolves** in the liquid.

[^7]: Here’s a clear answer to what you’re trying to understand about **partial pressure, partial vapor pressure, Henry’s law, and Raoult’s law**:
	
	**Partial Pressure vs. Partial Vapor Pressure**
	
	- **Partial Pressure** is the pressure that a single gas in a mixture would exert if it occupied the whole volume alone at the same temperature. It’s a general gas concept.
	    
	- **Partial Vapor Pressure** specifically refers to the pressure exerted by a component (usually a volatile liquid or its vapor) in a mixture where multiple substances can vaporize.
	    
	
	**Henry’s Law vs. Raoult’s Law**
	
	|Feature|Henry’s Law|Raoult’s Law|
	|---|---|---|
	|**Applies to**|Gases dissolved in liquids (dilute solutions, especially for non-volatile/less volatile solutes)|Volatile liquids in solution (ideal solutions, both components can vaporize)|
	|**Statement**|The partial pressure of a gas above a solution is proportional to its mole fraction in the solution: P=kH⋅xP = k_H \cdot xP=kH⋅x|The partial vapor pressure of a component in a solution is proportional to its mole fraction: P=PA∗⋅xAP = P^*_A \cdot x_AP=PA∗⋅xA|
	|**Constant**|kHk_HkH: Henry’s Law constant (varies for each gas-solvent pair and temperature)|PA∗P^*_APA∗: Vapor pressure of pure component A|
	|**Use case**|Describes gases slightly soluble in solvents|Describes behavior of ideal volatile liquid mixtures|
	
	**Summary:**
	
	- **Henry’s law** is mainly used for sparingly soluble gases in a liquid (like O₂ in water).
	    
	- **Raoult’s law** is for mixtures where both components can vaporize (like ethanol and water).
	    
	- Both laws relate vapor pressure to mole fraction, but apply in different contexts and use different proportionality constants.
	    
	
	So, yes, you’re right: **Henry’s law is primarily for gases, Raoult’s law is for (ideal) liquid mixtures.** The main difference is _what type of substance and solution each law describes_ and the proportionality constant they use.

[^8]: In the context of class 12 chemistry, chapter 1 (Solutions), enthalpy is discussed primarily as _enthalpy of solution_ (ΔHsolution\Delta H_{solution}ΔHsolution), which is the heat change that occurs when one mole of solute dissolves in a specified amount of solvent at constant pressure.[scribd+1](https://www.scribd.com/document/550594803/Chemical-Thermodynamics-Class-12th-Notes)​
	
	## Enthalpy in Solution Chemistry
	
	- **Definition in Chapter**: The enthalpy of solution (ΔHsolution\Delta H_{solution}ΔHsolution) is the total heat change when a solute dissolves in a solvent, which might be either absorbed (endothermic, ΔH>0\Delta H > 0ΔH>0) or released (exothermic, ΔH<0\Delta H < 0ΔH<0).[chem.libretexts+1](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Supplemental_Modules_\(Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry\)/Physical_Properties_of_Matter/Solutions_and_Mixtures/Solution_Basics/Enthalpy_of_Solution)​
	    
	- **Process Steps**: The formation of a solution involves three key steps:
	    
	    - Breaking solute-solute interactions (always requires heat, ΔH1>0\Delta H_1 > 0ΔH1>0)

	The overall enthalpy of solution is:
	
	ΔHsolution=ΔH1+ΔH2+ΔH3\Delta H_{solution} = \Delta H_1 + \Delta H_2 + \Delta H_3ΔHsolution=ΔH1+ΔH2+ΔH3
	
	where the sum determines if heat is absorbed or released during dissolution.[chem.libretexts](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Supplemental_Modules_\(Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry\)/Physical_Properties_of_Matter/Solutions_and_Mixtures/Solution_Basics/Enthalpy_of_Solution)​
	
	## Examples Relevant to the Chapter
	
	- **Sodium chloride (NaCl) in water**: When NaCl dissolves, crystal lattices of NaCl are broken (endothermic), water molecules are separated (endothermic), but when ions interact with water (hydration), heat is released (exothermic).[chem.libretexts](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Supplemental_Modules_\(Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry\)/Physical_Properties_of_Matter/Solutions_and_Mixtures/Solution_Basics/Enthalpy_of_Solution)​
	    
	- **Enthalpy of dilution and mixing**: The heat change during dilution or mixing solutions is also an application of enthalpy concepts discussed in this chapter.[scribd](https://www.scribd.com/document/550594803/Chemical-Thermodynamics-Class-12th-Notes)​
	    
	
	## Types of Enthalpy Related to Solution Chemistry

[^9]: ## **Azeotropic Mixtures Explained**
	
	**Azeotropes** are mixtures of two or more liquids that, when combined in a certain proportion, boil at a **constant temperature**. This special boiling point can be either higher or lower than the boiling point of any pure component in the mixture.
	
	## **Why is the composition unchanged during distillation?**
	
	When you boil a regular (non-azeotropic) mixture, the more volatile component (the one with a lower boiling point) tends to vaporize first. This means the composition of the liquid left behind keeps changing as distillation proceeds, and the mixture can be separated completely by distillation.
	
	However, in an **azeotropic mixture**, something unique happens: **the vapor produced during boiling has exactly the same composition as the liquid mixture.** This means:
	
	- As the azeotrope boils, it behaves like a single substance: both the vapor and remaining liquid keep the same ratio of the two liquids.
	    
	- **No further separation occurs** by distillation, because you can't enrich one component over the other this way.
	    
	
	> For example: The well-known ethanol-water azeotrope (about 95.6% ethanol, 4.4% water by mass) boils at 78.2°C; as it boils, both the vapor and the liquid have this exact composition. You cannot get pure ethanol by simply distilling this mixture.[wikipedia+2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azeotrope)​
	
	## **How does this connect to their behavior?**
	
	- **Constant boiling point:** Azeotropes boil at a fixed temperature, just like pure substances—even though they are mixtures.
	    
	- **No composition change:** During boiling and condensation, the ratio of liquids does not change between liquid and vapor, so you can't use simple or fractional distillation to separate the components.[britannica+2](https://www.britannica.com/science/azeotrope)​
	    
	
	## **Types of Azeotropes:**
	
	- **Minimum boiling azeotropes** (example: ethanol-water) have a boiling point lower than either pure liquid.
	    
	- **Maximum boiling azeotropes** (example: water-hydrochloric acid) boil at a higher temperature than either component in their pure form.[byjus+1](https://byjus.com/jee/azeotropic-mixture/)​
	    
	
	**In summary:**  
	Azeotropes are constant boiling mixtures whose composition remains unchanged by boiling/distillation, making them impossible to separate into pure components by simple distillation.
