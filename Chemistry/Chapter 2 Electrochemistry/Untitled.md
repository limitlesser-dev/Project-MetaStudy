## I. Introduction to Electrochemistry

**Definition and Scope** Electrochemistry is the branch of chemistry that deals with the relationship between **chemical energy and electrical energy** and their interconversion.

- It studies the production of electricity from energy released during spontaneous chemical reactions.
- It studies the use of electrical energy to bring about non-spontaneous chemical transformations.
- Electrochemical principles are fundamental to batteries, fuel cells, the production of various chemicals (sodium hydroxide, chlorine, fluorine), and the transmission of sensory signals in biological systems.

**Energy Conversion** Electrochemistry involves two main conversions:

1. **Chemical Energy to Electric Energy:** (e.g., a phone using its battery charge).
2. **Electric Energy to Chemical Energy:** (e.g., charging a phone battery, storing charge in chemical form).

## II. Electrochemical Cells: Fundamentals

An electrochemical cell is composed of two metallic electrodes dipping in electrolytic solutions. The sources cover two primary types: Electrolytic cells and Galvanic cells.

### A. General Electrode Definitions

Regardless of the cell type, electrodes are defined by the reaction occurring there:

- **Anode:** The electrode where **oxidation** (loss of electrons) takes place. Electrons flow out from the anode.
- **Cathode:** The electrode where **reduction** (gain of electrons) takes place. Electrons flow in towards the cathode.
---
Oxidation and reduction reactions are fundamental processes in chemistry, particularly in the context of electrochemistry, where they always occur together in what is known as a **Redox Reaction**.

### Oxidation Reaction

Oxidation is universally defined based on the chemical process occurring at the electrode, regardless of the cell type or electrical sign.

- **Process:** Oxidation is the process where a species **loses or donates electrons**.
- **Location:** Oxidation always takes place at the **Anode**.
- **Effect on Charge/State:** During oxidation, the substance breaks down, and its oxidation number increases.
- **Example Half-Reaction (Zinc in Daniel Cell):** Zinc releases electrons and turns into a positive ion: $$\text{Zn} (\text{s}) \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+} + 2e^-$$

### Reduction Reaction

Reduction is the opposite process of oxidation and is defined by the gain of electrons.

- **Process:** Reduction is the process where a species **gains or accepts electrons** (electrons are added).
- **Location:** Reduction always takes place at the **Cathode**.
- **Effect on Charge/State:** During reduction, electrons are consumed by the species. The oxidation number decreases.
- **Example Half-Reaction (Copper in Daniel Cell):** Copper ions accept electrons to become neutral copper metal: $$\text{Cu}^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{Cu} (\text{s})$$

### Redox Reaction Context

A redox reaction is a **chemical reaction involving electron transfer** ("electron आएगा और जाएगा"). In an electrochemical cell, the overall chemical reaction is a redox reaction. This spontaneous redox reaction (like $\text{Zn} + \text{Cu}^{2+} \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+} + \text{Cu}$) is used to convert chemical energy into electric energy.

### B. Electrolytic Cell (Electrolysis)
![[Pasted image 20251019213354.png]]
- **Function:** Uses electrical energy to cause a non-spontaneous chemical reaction (Electric $\rightarrow$ Chemical). This process is often called **electrolysis** (breaking down substances using electricity).
- **Apparatus:** The device used for electrolysis is the **Electrolytic Cell**.
- **Electrode Polarity:** In an electrolytic cell, the sign convention based on connection to the external source is:
    - **Anode is Positive (+)**.
    - **Cathode is Negative (-)**.
- **Example (Molten NaCl):** Electrical energy breaks molten NaCl into Na metal and $\text{Cl}_2$ gas.
---

### The Daniel Cell serves as a key, relatively easier example of an **Electrochemical Cell** (also known as a Voltaic or Galvanic cell).

### The Electrochemical Cell Context (Chemical to Electric)

An electrochemical cell is defined as a device or branch of chemistry that deals with the relationship between chemical energy and electric energy, and their interconversion. Specifically, in the type of electrochemical cell represented by the Daniel Cell, **chemical energy is converted into electric energy**. This conversion is driven by a spontaneous redox reaction (a chemical reaction involving electron transfer) which produces an electric current.

### Structure and Components of the Daniel Cell

The Daniel Cell is unique from an electrolytic cell because it uses **two separate compartments** (called half-cells):

1. **Zinc Half-Cell:** A thick **Zinc rod** is submerged in a solution of **Zinc Sulfate**.
2. **Copper Half-Cell:** A thin **Copper strip** is submerged in a solution of **Copper Sulfate**.

These half-cells are connected externally by a wire, usually passing through a galvanometer to detect the current flow, and internally by a **Salt Bridge** to complete the circuit.

### Reaction Mechanism and Polarity

The operation of the Daniel Cell relies on the fact that **Zinc is more reactive than Copper**. This difference in reactivity forces the movement of electrons, creating the electric current.

|Component|Process|Chemical Reaction|Polarity|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Anode** (Zinc Side)|**Oxidation** (Zinc gives electrons). Zinc breaks down, thinning the rod.|$\text{Zn} \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+} + 2e^-$|**Negative terminal**|
|**Cathode** (Copper Side)|**Reduction** (Copper ions gain electrons). Copper deposits on the strip, thickening it.|$\text{Cu}^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{Cu}$|**Positive terminal**|

The flow of **electrons** goes from the Anode (Zinc) to the Cathode (Copper), while the resulting **electric current** flows in the opposite direction.

The **overall reaction** is essentially a displacement reaction occurring across two separate containers: $\text{Zn} + \text{Cu}^{2+} \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+} + \text{Cu}$.

**Key Distinction in Polarity:** A crucial concept emphasized in the sources is that while oxidation always occurs at the Anode and reduction at the Cathode in any cell, the polarity differs. In the Daniel Cell (Electrochemical Cell), the **Anode is Negative** and the **Cathode is Positive**, which is the reverse of what happens in an Electrolytic Cell.

### Potential and Representation

Under standard conditions, the Daniel Cell provides a potential (E° cell) of **1.1 Volts**. The cell is represented using the standard notation: Anode || Cathode.

$$\text{Zn} | \text{Zn}^{2+} || \text{Cu}^{2+} | \text{Cu} \quad$$

---
### C. Galvanic Cell (Voltaic Cell)

- **Function:** Converts the chemical energy of a **spontaneous redox reaction** into electrical energy (Chemical $\rightarrow$ Electric).
- **Apparatus:** A device where a chemical change produces an electric current.
- **Electrode Polarity:** In a galvanic cell, the sign convention is the reverse of an electrolytic cell:
    - **Anode is Negative (-)**.
    - **Cathode is Positive (+)**.
- **Construction:** Typically contains two separate compartments (or half-cells).
    - A half-cell consists of a metallic electrode dipped into an electrolyte.
    - The compartments are joined by an external wire (with a galvanometer/voltmeter) and an internal **Salt Bridge**.

**The Salt Bridge**

The **salt bridge** is a crucial component necessary for the proper functioning of the **Electrochemical Cell** (also known as the Galvanic or Voltaic cell).

### Function and Necessity in Electrochemical Cells

The primary role of the salt bridge is to **complete the electrical circuit**.

1. **Circuit Completion:** In an electrochemical cell like the Daniel Cell, two half-cells (the zinc half-cell and the copper half-cell) are physically separate compartments. The external connection (wire/voltmeter/galvanometer) allows electrons to flow from the anode to the cathode, but this external path alone does not complete the circuit. The salt bridge connects the electrolytes of the two half-cells internally to complete the circuit.
2. **Maintaining Electrical Neutrality:** The salt bridge prevents the buildup of charge in the half-cells, thereby maintaining **electrical neutrality**.
    - During the spontaneous redox reaction, the anode (e.g., Zinc half-cell) generates positive ions ($\text{Zn}^{2+}$), causing the solution there to become excessively positive.
    - The cathode (e.g., Copper half-cell) consumes positive ions ($\text{Cu}^{2+}$), potentially leading to a buildup of negative ions (e.g., $\text{SO}_{4}^{2-}$).
    - If electrical neutrality is not maintained, the cell potential will quickly drop, and the current flow will cease. The salt bridge prevents this positive/negative buildup, allowing the circuit to operate continuously.

### Composition and Structure

The salt bridge typically consists of a **U-shaped pipe** or tube containing a paste or gel that includes salts.

- **Materials:** It contains salts such as $\text{KCl}$, $\text{KNO}_{3}$, or $\text{NaNO}_{3}$.
- **Preparation:** These salts are mixed into a **gel** (like agar gel) or a paste. The use of a gel is important because it contains water (necessary for conduction) but prevents the solution from flowing out or mixing with the electrolytes in the half-cells.
- **Non-Reactivity:** The salts used in the bridge must be chosen carefully so that they **do not react** with the electrolytes in the two half-cells.

### When the Salt Bridge is Used

A salt bridge is specifically required when the two half-cells use **separate electrolyte solutions** (as in the Daniel Cell). If a galvanic cell is constructed such that both electrodes dip into the same electrolyte solution, then a salt bridge is not required.

### Representation

In the standard representation of a galvanic cell, the salt bridge is symbolized by **two vertical lines** ($||$) placed between the representations of the two half-cells. _Example (Daniel Cell):_ $\text{Zn} | \text{Zn}^{2+} || \text{Cu}^{2+} | \text{Cu}$.
- **Purpose:** Completes the circuit. It maintains electrical neutrality in the two half-cells.
- **Composition:** A bridge typically made of a U-shaped pipe containing a paste (like gel) with inert salts (e.g., KNO₃, NaNO₃, KCl) that do not react with the electrolytes.

**Cell Representation (IUPAC Convention)** The galvanic cell is represented by keeping the anode on the left and the cathode on the right:

1. A single vertical line ($|$) is placed between the metal and the electrolyte solution.
2. A double vertical line ($||$) represents the salt bridge connecting the two electrolytes.
3. Format: Anode (Oxidation) | Salt Bridge | Cathode (Reduction).

- _Example (Daniell Cell):_ $Zn(s)|Zn^{2+}(aq)||Cu^{2+}(aq)|Cu(s)$.

**Daniell Cell Example** The standard potential of the Daniell cell is 1.1 V.

- **Overall Reaction:** $Zn(s) + Cu^{2+}(aq) \rightarrow Zn^{2+}(aq) + Cu(s)$.
- **Anode (Oxidation):** $Zn(s) \rightarrow Zn^{2+} + 2e^-$.
- **Cathode (Reduction):** $Cu^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow Cu(s)$.

## III. Cell Potentials (E cell)

### A. Electrode Potential and Standard Conditions

- **Electrode Potential:** The tendency of a metal to lose or gain electrons when it is placed in contact with its own solution.
- **Standard Electrode Potential ($E^{\circ}$):** Electrode potential measured at standard conditions.
    - **Standard Conditions:** Temperature (T) = 298 K; Pressure (P) = 1 atm (or 1 bar for gases); Concentration (C) = 1 M (one molar).
    - IUPAC convention specifies that Standard Reduction Potentials are used as standard electrode potentials.
- **Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE):** The potential of a single half-cell cannot be measured individually. The SHE is used as a reference electrode for measurement.
    - Its potential is **assumed to be zero (0 V)** at all temperatures under standard conditions.
    - It consists of a Platinum electrode dipped in a 1 M $\text{H}^{+}$ solution with $\text{H}_2$ gas bubbled at 1 bar pressure.
![[Pasted image 20251020131210.png]]

### B. Standard Cell Potential ($E^{\circ}_{cell}$)

- $E^{\circ}_{cell}$ is the difference between the electrode potentials (reduction potentials) of the cathode and anode.
- **Formula:** $$E^{\circ}_{cell} = E^{\circ}_{cathode} - E^{\circ}_{anode}$$
    - _Note:_ Both $E^{\circ}$ values must be Standard Reduction Potentials (SRPs).
- **Determining Anode/Cathode from SRPs:** The species with the **higher (more positive) Standard Reduction Potential** will undergo reduction and act as the cathode.

### C. Nernst Equation

The Nernst equation allows calculation of the cell potential ($E_{cell}$) under non-standard conditions (i.e., when concentrations are not 1 M or T is not 298 K).

For a general electrochemical reaction $aA + bB \rightleftharpoons cC + dD$, where only aqueous species are included in the reaction quotient (Q): $$E_{cell} = E^{\circ}_{cell} - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln Q$$ $$Q = \frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b}$$

**Simplified Nernst Equation (at T = 298 K)** By substituting standard values for R, T, and F, and converting the natural logarithm ($\ln$) to $\log_{10}$, the equation simplifies to: $$E_{cell} = E^{\circ}_{cell} - \frac{0.059}{n} \log \frac{[\text{Product ions}]}{[\text{Reactant ions}]}$$

**Key Constants used in Nernst Equation:**

- **R (Gas Constant):** 8.314 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹.
- **T (Temperature):** Temperature in Kelvin (K). Often assumed to be 298 K.
- **n:** Number of moles of electrons transferred in the balanced cell reaction.
- **F (Faraday Constant):** The charge on 1 mole of electrons.
    - Value: Approximately 96,500 C mol⁻¹ (Coulombs per mole).

### D. Thermodynamics and Equilibrium

- **Gibbs Free Energy ($\Delta_r G$):** The reversible work done by a galvanic cell is equal to the decrease in its Gibbs energy.
    - **Formula (General):** $\Delta_r G = -nFE_{cell}$.
    - **Formula (Standard Conditions):** $$\Delta_r G^{\circ} = -nF E^{\circ}_{cell}$$.
- **Equilibrium Constant ($K_c$):** When equilibrium is attained, the cell voltage ($E_{cell}$) becomes zero.
    - **Formula (General):** $$E^{\circ}_{cell} = \frac{2.303RT}{nF} \log K_c$$.
    - **Formula (at 298 K):** $$E^{\circ}_{cell} = \frac{0.059}{n} \log K_c$$.
- **Relation between $\Delta_r G^{\circ}$ and $K_c$:** $$\Delta_r G^{\circ} = -RT \ln K_c$$.

## IV. Conductance of Electrolytic Solutions

### A. Basic Definitions and Relationships

| Property                                | Symbol           | Formula           | Unit (SI/Common)                   | Relationship           |
| :-------------------------------------- | :--------------- | :---------------- | :--------------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| **Resistance**                          | R                |                   | $\Omega$ (Ohm)                     | $R = \rho (l/A)$       |
| **Resistivity** (Specific Resistance)   | $\rho$ (rho)     |                   | $\Omega m$ or $\Omega cm$          | $R = \rho (l/A)$       |
| **Conductance**                         | G                | $G = 1/R$         | S (Siemens) or $\Omega^{-1}$ (mho) | Inverse of Resistance  |
| **Conductivity** (Specific Conductance) | $\kappa$ (kappa) | $\kappa = 1/\rho$ | $S m^{-1}$ or $S cm^{-1}$          | Inverse of Resistivity |
| **Cell Constant**                       | $G^*$            | $G^* = l/A$       | $m^{-1}$ or $cm^{-1}$              | $\kappa = G \cdot G^*$ |
![[Pasted image 20251020153758.png]]
![[Pasted image 20251020154004.png]]
- **Resistivity** is physically defined as the resistance of a substance when it is 1 meter long and has an area of cross-section of 1 $m^2$.
- **Conductance** represents the ease by which charge flows.
- In chemistry, units like $S cm^{-1}$ and $S cm^2 mol^{-1}$ are often used rather than SI units due to the size constraints of typical conductivity cells.
![[Pasted image 20251020155651.png]]
### B. Types of Conductance

1. **Electronic (Metallic) Conductance:** Due to the movement of electrons. Depends on the nature of the metal and the number of ==valence electrons==. **Decreases** with an increase in temperature.
2. **Electrolytic (Ionic) Conductance:** Due to the movement of ions present in the solution. Depends on the concentration, size/solvation of ions, nature/viscosity of the solvent, and temperature. **Increases** with an increase in temperature.

### C. Molar Conductivity ($\Lambda_m$)
![[Pasted image 20251020173510.png]]
- **Definition:** Molar conductivity is the conductivity of a solution divided by its molar concentration, representing the conductivity per unit concentration. It is the conductance of the volume (V) of solution containing one mole of electrolyte kept between two electrodes separated by unit length.
- **Unit (Common):** $S cm^2 mol^{-1}$.
- **Formula (Practical):** When $\kappa$ is in $S cm^{-1}$ and concentration (C) is in $mol L^{-1}$: $$\Lambda_m = \frac{\kappa \times 1000}{C}$$

### D. Variation with Concentration

- **Conductivity ($\kappa$):** Always **decreases** with dilution (decrease in concentration) for both weak and strong electrolytes because the number of ions per unit volume decreases.
- **Molar Conductivity ($\Lambda_m$):** **Increases** with dilution (decrease in concentration). The decrease in $\kappa$ is more than compensated by the increase in the total volume (V) containing one mole of electrolyte.
- **Limiting Molar Conductivity ($\Lambda^{\circ}_m$):** The maximum value of molar conductivity, attained when concentration approaches zero (infinite dilution).

|Electrolyte Type|Variation with Dilution (C decrease)|Behavior|
|:--|:--|:--|
|**Strong** (e.g., KCl)|$\Lambda_m$ increases slowly.|The slope is constant (linear on a $\Lambda_m$ vs. $\sqrt{C}$ plot).|
|**Weak** (e.g., Acetic Acid)|$\Lambda_m$ increases steeply.|Increase is due to the increase in the **degree of dissociation** ($\alpha$). $\Lambda^{\circ}_m$ cannot be obtained by simple extrapolation.|

### E. Kohlrausch Law and Applications

- **Name:** Kohlrausch law of independent migration of ions.
- **Statement:** The limiting molar conductivity ($\Lambda^{\circ}_m$) of an electrolyte can be represented as the sum of the individual contributions ($\lambda^{\circ}$) of the anion and cation at infinite dilution.
- **Formula:** $$\Lambda^{\circ}_m = n_{+} \lambda^{\circ}_{+} + n_{-} \lambda^{\circ}_{-}$$ where $n_{+}$ and $n_{-}$ are the number of cations and anions produced upon dissociation.

**Degree of Dissociation and Dissociation Constant** Kohlrausch law is essential for weak electrolytes.

- **Degree of Dissociation ($\alpha$):** The ratio of molar conductivity ($\Lambda_m$) at a concentration ($c$) to the limiting molar conductivity ($\Lambda^{\circ}_m$): $$\alpha = \frac{\Lambda_m}{\Lambda^{\circ}_m}$$
- **Dissociation Constant ($K_a$):** For a weak electrolyte (like acetic acid) that dissociates into two ions, the dissociation constant is given by the formula from chemical equilibrium: $$K_a = \frac{C \alpha^2}{1-\alpha}$$

## V. Quantitative Aspects of Electrolysis (Faraday's Laws)

Faraday's laws describe the quantitative aspects of **electrolysis** (electrolytic cells).

- **Quantity of Electricity (Charge, Q):** $Q = I \times t$, where $I$ is current (Amperes) and $t$ is time (seconds).
- **Faraday (F):** The charge on one mole of electrons, 96,487 C mol⁻¹ (often approximated as 96,500 C mol⁻¹).

**1. Faraday's First Law** The mass (W) of substance deposited or liberated at any electrode is proportional to the quantity of electricity (Q) passed through the electrolyte. $$W \propto Q \implies W = ZIT$$

- $Z$: The electrochemical equivalent or equivalent weight.
- To calculate the mass deposited in grams, the formula incorporates the molar mass and valence ($n_e$) and requires division by the Faraday constant (F).

**2. Faraday's Second Law** When the same quantity of electricity is passed through different electrolytic solutions, the amounts of different substances liberated are proportional to their chemical equivalent weights.

## VI. Batteries and Fuel Cells

Cells and batteries are essentially galvanic cells converting chemical energy into electrical energy.

    - **Special Feature:** Provides **constant potential** (approx. 1.35 V) throughout its life because the overall reaction does not involve any ions in solution whose concentration can change.

### B. Secondary Batteries (Rechargeable)

These cells use **reversible** chemical reactions and can be recharged by passing current in the opposite direction.

1. **Lead Storage Battery**:

    - **Charging:** The discharge reaction is reversed, converting $\text{PbSO}_4(s)$ back into $\text{Pb}$ and $\text{PbO}_2$.
2. **Nickel-Cadmium Cell (Ni-Cd):** Has a longer life than the lead storage cell but is more expensive.
    

### C. Fuel Cells

Fuel cells are galvanic cells designed to convert the energy of combustion of fuels (like $\text{H}_2$, methane, methanol) directly into electrical energy.

- **H₂–O₂ Fuel Cell:** Used in the Apollo space program.
    - **Overall Reaction:** $2\text{H}_2(g) + \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)$.
    - The water produced is clean enough to be condensed and used as drinking water by astronauts.

---

## VII. Corrosion

- **Definition:** An electrochemical phenomenon where a metal is oxidized by losing electrons to oxygen, often forming oxides or other salts of the metal. Examples include rusting (iron), tarnishing (silver), and green coating (copper).
- **Mechanism (Iron Rusting):**
    1. **Anodic Spot (Oxidation):** Iron loses electrons: $2Fe(s) \rightarrow 2Fe^{2+} + 4e^-$.
    2. **Cathodic Spot (Reduction):** Oxygen is reduced in the presence of $\text{H}^{+}$ ions (available from atmospheric $\text{CO}_2$ dissolved in water): $O_2(g) + 4H^+(aq) + 4e^- \rightarrow 2H_2O(l)$.
    3. **Rust Formation:** $\text{Fe}^{2+}$ ions are further oxidized by atmospheric oxygen to ferric ions ($\text{Fe}^{3+}$), which form hydrated ferric oxide ($\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3 \cdot x\text{H}_2\text{O}$), or rust.
- **Prevention:** Preventing contact with the atmosphere (e.g., painting); covering the surface with other metals (Sn, Zn); or providing a **sacrificial electrode** (e.g., Mg, Zn) which corrodes preferentially.
