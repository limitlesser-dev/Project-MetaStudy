# 📓 June 21, 2025 — First Physics Log

Let’s begin with a **precise goal** — something small, manageable, and executable fast. A tiny experiment. Because tiny things compound into big ones.

The subject I’m choosing is **Physics** — Class 12 Physics, to be specific.

I’ve just entered Class 12. I have **no prior knowledge** of the syllabus, and I’m an average student in class. So this is a ground-up experiment — a real one.

---

## 🎯 The Starting Point

We’re going with Physics. The first chapter: **Electric Charges and Fields**.

I’ll be using the NCERT book as my base. I’ll upload it to the GitHub repo — feel free to check it out there.

First impression: lots of text, diagrams, and repetition. Not all of it is exam-relevant.

So the goal is **understanding concepts**, not blind memorization.

---

## 🧠 Defining the Approach

The focus is understanding — with a **human-centered, experiment-driven** approach.

I’ll be using **ChatGPT** throughout this project: sharing the prompts I use, responses I get, and how I apply them.

This is also a meta-experiment: **how fast can someone learn using smarter methods?** I want to challenge the idea that you need a full year to master a syllabus.

Let’s break down the plan.

---

## 🧰 Tools for Understanding

- **YouTube** – fast, visual understanding
    
- **NCERT Book** – for fact-checking
    
- **ChatGPT** – to break down, refine, and test concepts
    

Thinking frameworks:

- **First Principles Thinking**
    
- **Second-Order Thinking** (maybe)
    

These will be documented in markdown inside `/docs/`. I might write them myself or use AI to help — speed is key.

## ⚠️ Quick Note on NCERT & Boards

I’m in the **MP Board**, but NCERT is the foundation for most Indian school boards (CBSE, ICSE, etc.). Extra content (like Shiv Lal books) usually builds on that base.

So NCERT may not match the exact exam format, but it’s still the **core**.

---

## 🧪 The Actual Plan

YouTube videos vary in quality, but my metric is **clarity**.

I’ll start with the **Science and Fun** channel — seems like a good first step for this chapter.

---

## ✅ Ready to Begin

So now I’ve got the subject, chapter, book, and tools in place. This is **Day 1** of the experiment.

Here’s how it started:

I sat down to study… and felt instantly sleepy. I quit, distracted myself for an hour, and realized: I wasn’t just tired — I was **unstructured**. I didn’t know _how_ to start.

That’s when I discovered the **power of pause**.

I realized my brain wasn’t struggling with the topic — it was struggling with **multitasking**. And our brains aren’t built for multitasking. They do **one thing best at a time**.

### ⏸ The Pause Method

So here’s what I’m trying now:

1. Watch a video for **5 minutes**
    
2. **Pause**
    
3. **Recall out loud** what I just learned — even if it sounds like mumbling
    

This activates **active recall**, improves memory, and builds focus.

At the end of the day: a quick **revision** to support **spaced repetition**.

### ☁️ Priming Focus

Before deep focus work, I now **calm my mind** through breathing. Minimize distractions. Then I use the **Pomodoro technique** — 25-minute work blocks — to commit.

During that window, I:

- Use **First Principles** to test my understanding
    
- Apply the **Teach-Back method** (explain it to myself)
    
- Use **Gemini (Google AI Studio)** to generate **detailed notes** from YouTube lectures
    

I was impressed by how complete Gemini's notes were — good enough to skip rewatching videos. I’ll convert them into **flashcards** next.

---

## 📉 The First Real Challenge

But here's where things got complicated.

The video I picked is **3 hours long**, and Gemini maxes out at **~1.5 million tokens**. When I tried feeding it timestamps in Google AI Studio, it gave me the **first-hour notes again**, even when I asked for the second hour.

Possible issues:

- Network lag
    
- Gemini's limitations with timestamps
    
- General model confusion
    

Other models like **No GPT** tried to help by transcribing and summarizing, but they lacked context — especially for **visual-heavy content** like formulas and diagrams.

That’s when I tried **NotebookLM** from Google.

---

## 🧠 New Insight: NotebookLM

NotebookLM is designed specifically for studying and research.

- **Audio summaries** = great for revision
    
- **Interactive Q&A** = great for concept discussions
    
- You can ask direct questions based on video content
    

But I still felt that Gemini via **Google AI Studio** gave me **richer, more detailed notes**.

Then I wondered if NotebookLM was still running on **Gemini 2.0**, but after checking (via **Perplexity**), I found it now uses **Gemini 2.5 Flash** — much better.

---

## 📼 My Workaround

To solve the token limit issue:

1. Download the full 3-hour video
    
2. Trim it into **1-hour chunks**
    
3. Feed each chunk separately to Gemini
    

Yes, it’s slow. Yes, it takes effort. But it **works**, and I get the detail I want.

It took 1–2 hours to fully process and transcript a single chunk. My laptop ran hot. But the result: high-quality notes, ready for flashcards and spaced revision.

---

## 🔁 Final Workflow Summary

Here’s how I’ve set up my system:

- **Perplexity** – for curiosity, side questions, out-of-syllabus stuff
    
- **NotebookLM** – my main **study and revision** tool
    
- **Gemini (AI Studio)** – for **deep, detailed notes**
    
- **Obsidian** – to organize everything locally
    
- **GitHub** – to version and publish it all
    

🔗 I’ll share my Physics Notebook and resources via public links soon.

---

## 🧪 Bonus Test

I’m also experimenting with **Gemini’s ability to format and clean this entire journal**. Just gave it the full input to see how it handles structuring and spell-checking.

For **audio-to-text**, I’m using **ChatGPT’s Whisper**, which I think is still the best speech recognition model available. (Unless there’s something newer I’ve missed.)

---

That’s it for Day 1.

**This is real. This is experimental. And I’m in it.**

Let’s see how far I can take it.
