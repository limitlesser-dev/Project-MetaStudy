### **ðŸ““ June 21, 2025 â€” First Physics Log**

Okay, first, I need a precise goalâ€”something I can achieve quickly. A tiny experiment. Because tiny things make up big things.

The subject is **Physics**. Class 12 Physics, to be exact.

I have zero prior knowledge of the Class 12 syllabus since I just started the year. I'm an average student, so this is going to be a full-blown experiment from scratch. A real one.

My starting point is **Chapter 1: Electric Charges and Fields** from the NCERT book. Looking at it, I see a ton of text and diagrams, and I know most of it is repetitive explanation that won't show up on the exam. So, my main goal is to **learn the concepts**, not just blindly memorize stuff.

For this experiment, I want to prove how fast someone can study **if they use smarter methods**. You don't need a whole year to finish a class. My tools will be YouTube videos for fast visuals, the NCERT book for fact-checking, and ChatGPT/Gemini to break down concepts. I'll also try to use mental models like First Principles Thinking.

Okay, so when I actually tried to start studying, I immediately felt so sleepy that I had to stop. I went and did something else for an hour, feeling unsure if I could actually do this without a solid plan.

Then it hit me. I just learned **the power of the pause**.

I realized I felt sleepy because I was trying to do too many tasks at once. My mind got confused and couldn't focus. The brain isn't designed for multitasking; itâ€™s designed to do one thing at its best, one at a time.

This is where the power of the pause comes in. My new plan is to watch a lecture for five minutes, then pause it and try to recall everything that happened. Iâ€™ll just mumble it to myself, trying to make sure I actually understand what's going on. This will trigger my active recall and improve my memory. Then, at the end of the day, I'll do a quick revision for spaced repetition.

I also realized that before starting something that requires a lot of focus, I need to *activate* my focus. I can do this with some calm breathing to minimize distractions. To make myself actually sit down and do the work, I used the Pomodoro Technique, telling myself I only had to focus for 25 minutes. After that, I used the "teach it to yourself" method and First Principles to check my understanding.

I also used Gemini to make detailed notes for the chapter directly from a YouTube video. I have to say, I was surprised by the detailâ€”the notes are pretty good. Now I don't have to watch the video again and again, and I can make flashcards from the notes.

But then, a challenge. The YouTube video I chose is three hours long. When I tried to get Gemini in Google AI Studio to process it, it exceeded the token limit. I tried using timestamps to get notes for the second hour, but the model just kept giving me notes from the first hour. I don't know if it was my network or a bug, but it wasn't working.

I looked for other solutions, but most AIs aren't truly multimodal. They just transcribe the audio to text and then summarize it. This is a huge problem for physics because it misses all the visual information, like formulas and diagrams.

Then I thought, why not try NotebookLM? It's from Google and is specifically made for study and research. And it was a breakthrough. The audio summaries are perfect for revision, and the interactive mode lets you have a discussion about the topic. You can ask questions directly about the video, which is amazing for recall and understanding.

Still, I felt the detailed notes from Gemini in AI Studio were higher quality. For a minute, I considered a long, painful process: download the three-hour video, trim it into one-hour chunks, and feed them to Gemini one by one. It would work, but it would take forever.

As the day is about to end, here are my conclusions. That trimming process took almost two hours just for one video, so it's not a sustainable method. But I did some research on Perplexity and found out that **NotebookLM actually uses Gemini 1.5 Flash**. My concern was that it was using an older model, but now that I know it's updated, I'm at ease.

So here is my final workflow:
*   **For in-depth study, discussion, and revision:** I'll use **NotebookLM** as my main study base, putting the source links directly in there.
*   **For random, out-of-subject questions:** I'll use **Perplexity**.
*   **For project management:** I'll use **Obsidian**.
*   **For posting my progress:** I'll use **GitHub**.

One last thing. I wanted to test feeding this whole raw journal entry to Gemini to see how well it could format it and correct the spelling. I dictated most of this using ChatGPT's Whisper for audio-to-text, which I think is one of the best models for speech recognition out there. Let's see what it does.
