**Chapter:** Maths – Class 12 – Chapter 3 (NCERT)

Today I officially started working on Project Metastudy. I didn’t start from Chapter 1. I left that and directly picked up Chapter 3. The main question was, _how do I study this chapter in the best way possible?_ Because maths is not like other subjects. It’s tough and logical, and I didn’t want to waste time doing it the old way.

So the first thing I did was try **NotebookLM**. I wanted to see if I could use it to learn maths. But after trying for some time, I realised that NotebookLM is not made for learning maths properly. It’s good for research, physics, chemistry maybe, but not for actual maths teaching. It doesn’t guide you step-by-step the way I want.

So I switched and went to **Gemini**. I gave it a clear prompt:  
“From now on, you are my maths teacher. You use modern techniques to teach. Today we are doing Class 12 NCERT Chapter 3.”

Gemini responded well. It broke the chapter into around 10 parts. The approach was simple: first, it will teach me theory. Then, I will do the practice myself. That way, my base gets strong.

I liked the idea and started reading. But soon I realised that the way Gemini writes maths — without proper formatting or layout — was hard to understand. No columns, no spacing — just plain text. And for maths, that doesn’t work.

So I stopped and thought: _What’s the solution?_

Then I remembered I have been using **Obsidian** for 2 months. I know how it works. So I told Gemini to respond in Obsidian markdown format.

And that changed everything.

Now the notes were readable. Proper structure. And most importantly, I was using AI to teach me. So no distractions, no confusion. Just focus. I was able to go much faster than usual. I think around 5 times faster. Whenever I had a doubt, I just asked Gemini, and it explained. It felt natural.

In just under 2 days, I completed the whole **theory** part of Chapter 3. Now only questions and exercises are left. I’m confident I can do that because my theory is clear.

All the notes are saved in Obsidian inside the **Mathematics folder**. The doubts are in a separate **doubts folder** under Chapter 3. It’s all organized.

One more idea I had — I can use these notes as a source and upload them to NotebookLM if I want to test or revise later.

Honestly, I didn’t think AI could teach me maths. But it did. And it did well. I still think it’s harder for AI to teach maths compared to chemistry or physics, but this method worked.

If Gemini had a “read aloud” button like ChatGPT, it would be even better.

But overall, I’m happy with how today went. One chapter’s theory is done. And I’m going to keep doing this — chapter by chapter.
