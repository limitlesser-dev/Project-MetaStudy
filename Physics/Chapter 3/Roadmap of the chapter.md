| **Basic Definitions**                  | **Electricity** is a form of energy produced by charge particles in motion (flow of charges). **Electric Current ($I$)** is the rate of flow of charge: $I = \Delta Q / \Delta t$ or $I = dQ/dt$. SI Unit is the Ampere (A), equivalent to Coulomb per second.                                                                            |                   |
| **Current Direction**                  | **Conventional Current** flows from positive to negative. **Electronic Current** (actual electron flow) is from negative to positive, opposite the conventional current.                                                                                                                                                                  |                   |
| **EMF and Potential Difference**       | **Electromotive Force (EMF, $\mathcal{E}$)** is defined as the work done by the source in taking a unit positive charge from lower potential to higher potential. It is the potential difference between terminals in an open circuit (when no current flows). It can be understood as the **maximum potential difference** of a circuit. |                   |
| **Ohm's Law**                          | **Voltage ($V$) is directly proportional to Current ($I$)** when temperature and physical dimensions are constant. The relation is $V = IR$, where $R$ is the constant of proportionality called **Resistance**. Resistance is an obstruction to the flow of current.                                                                     |                   |
| **Resistance Factors and Resistivity** | Resistance ($R$) is directly proportional to length ($L$) and inversely proportional to the area of cross-section ($A$). This yields the formula $R = \rho L/A$. **Resistivity ($\rho$)** depends on the nature of the material and temperature. Its SI unit is **Ohm-meter ($\Omega \cdot m$)**.                                         |                   |
| **Temperature Dependence**             | For conductors, increasing temperature increases resistance and resistivity. The relationship is given by $R_2 = R_1[1 + \alpha (T_2 - T_1)]$ or $\rho_T = \rho_0 [1 + \alpha (T-T_0)]$.                                                                                                                                                  |                   |
| **Drift and Mobility**                 | **Drift Velocity ($v_d$)** is the average velocity acquired by electrons when an electric field is applied. **Relaxation Time ($\tau$)** is the average time between two successive collisions of a charge particle. The formula derived is $v_d = -eE\tau/m$. **Current ($I$) is related to drift velocity** by $I = -neAv_d$.           |                   |
| **Ohm's Law Origin**                   | Ohm's law ($V \propto I$) is proven through the microscopic relations, demonstrating that $R$ is constant if temperature and dimensions are constant. Resistivity is microscopically defined as $\rho = m/(ne^2\tau)$.                                                                                                                    |                   |
| **Mobility ($\mu$)**                   | Mobility is the magnitude of drift velocity per unit electric field applied: $\mu =                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | v_d               |
| **Limitations**                        | Discussion of **Ohmic** (follow $V \propto I$, e.g., metals) and **Non-Ohmic** (do not follow $V \propto I$, e.g., semiconductors like GaAs and diodes) substances.                                                                                                                                                                       |                   |

### Phase 2: Circuit Analysis, Laws, and Applications (Focus on Complex Circuits)

This phase delves into how resistance and power are calculated in circuits, focusing on complex analysis techniques and practical applications.

|Topic|Key Concepts and Definitions|Source References|
|:--|:--|:--|
|**Resistor Combinations**|**Series:** Current is the same; voltage divides. Net resistance $R_{net} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + ...$. **Parallel:** Voltage is the same; current divides. Net resistance $1/R_{net} = 1/R_1 + 1/R_2 + 1/R_3 + ...$.||
|**Electric Power and Energy**|**Electric Power ($P$)** is the rate of doing electric work: $P = \text{Work Done} / \text{Time}$. Formulas derived from Ohm's Law: $P = IV = I^2 R = V^2/R$. **Commercial Unit of Energy** is the Kilowatt-hour (kWh), which equals $36$ lakh Joules.||
|**Heating Effect (Joule's Law)**|Heat produced ($H$) is $H = I^2 RT$. This effect is used in heating appliances (like those using Nichrome alloy due to its high resistance), but causes energy loss in devices like old bulbs.||
|**Kirchhoff's Laws (Crucial)**|**Junction Rule (KCL):** The sum of currents entering a junction equals the sum of currents leaving it. Based on the **Law of Conservation of Charge**. **Loop Rule (KVL):** The algebraic sum of changes in potential around any closed loop is zero. Based on the **Law of Conservation of Energy**.||
|**Wheatstone Bridge (Crucial)**|A special arrangement of **five resistances** (four in a quadrilateral and one in the galvanometer arm). The **Balanced Condition** occurs when the current through the central resistance (galvanometer, $I_G$) is zero. The balance condition formula is $P/Q = R/S$ or $R_2/R_1 = R_4/R_3$.||
|**EMF and Internal Resistance**|**Internal Resistance ($r$)** is the resistance within the cell or battery itself. The terminal voltage ($V$) during discharge is related to EMF ($E$) and internal resistance by the formula $V = E - IR$. A graph of V vs. I yields a straight line with a **negative slope** ($m = -r$) and a Y-intercept equal to E (EMF).||
|**Cell Combinations**|**Series:** Equivalent EMF is the sum of individual EMFs ($\mathcal{E}_{eq} = \mathcal{E}_1 + \mathcal{E}_2 + ...$); internal resistances add up ($r_{eq} = r_1 + r_2 + ...$). **Parallel:** More complex formulas are used for net EMF and net internal resistance. Cells are typically wired in series for use (e.g., in a remote) but in parallel for charging.||

This roadmap emphasizes the critical theoretical elements, derivations, and problem-solving techniques necessary to master the chapter, particularly focusing on Kirchhoff's Laws and the Wheatstone Bridge, which are deemed "most important" for examination purposes.
