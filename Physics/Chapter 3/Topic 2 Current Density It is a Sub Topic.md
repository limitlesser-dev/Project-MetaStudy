That is an excellent way to place Current Density ($\mathbf{J}$) into the broader framework of Electric Current ($I$). While electric current describes the overall flow of charge, current density provides a localized, directional measure of that flow.

Here is a discussion of Current Density ($\mathbf{J}$) based on the sources, within the context of Electric Current ($I$):

### 🎯 Current Density ($\mathbf{J}$): Definition and Context

Current density ($\mathbf{J}$ or $j$) provides a specific measure of how concentrated the electric current is within a conductor.

- **Definition Relative to Current ($I$):** Current density is defined as the amount of current ($I$) flowing **per unit area**.
- **Perpendicular Condition:** This area must be held **normal** (perpendicular) to the direction of the current flow.
- **Formula:** For a uniform current flow across a perpendicular area ($A$), the magnitude of the current density ($j$) is given by: $$j = \frac{I}{A}$$
- **Units:** The SI units for current density are $\mathbf{A/m^2}$ (Amperes per square meter).

In the context of the basic definition of current, which is the net charge passing per unit time, current density can also be expressed as the **amount of charge flowing per second per unit area**.

### ↔️ Current Density as a Vector Quantity

The nature of Current Density differs fundamentally from that of Electric Current ($I$):

1. **Current ($I$) is a Scalar:** Electric current ($I$), although represented with a directed arrow in diagrams, is a **scalar quantity** because it does not obey the laws of vector addition.
2. **Current Density ($\mathbf{J}$) is a Vector:** Current density ($\mathbf{J}$ or $\mathbf{j}$) is a **vector quantity**. It is directed along the electric field ($\mathbf{E}$).

This distinction is mathematically captured by relating the scalar current ($I$) to the current density vector ($\mathbf{J}$) and the area vector ($\mathbf{A}$).

#### Flow Through Non-Normal Areas

The definition requiring the area to be normal to the current flow is crucial. If the area's normal is **not** parallel to the current flow (i.e., the area is not perpendicular to the flow), the current must be calculated using the component of the area that is normal to the flow.

- If the area vector $\mathbf{A}$ makes an angle $\theta$ with the direction of the current/current density ($\mathbf{J}$), the relationship is: $$\mathbf{I = J A \cos \theta}$$
- Since $\mathbf{J}$ and $\mathbf{A}$ are vectors and $\cos \theta$ is involved, this expression is equivalent to a **dot product**: $$\mathbf{I = \mathbf{J} \cdot \mathbf{A}}$$

### 🔬 Relation to Microscopic Flow and Ohm's Law

Current density bridges the macroscopic observation of current ($I$) with the microscopic motion of charge carriers (like electrons) and the electric field ($\mathbf{E}$) applied across the conductor.

1. **Drift Velocity Connection:** Current density is directly linked to the drift velocity ($\mathbf{v}_d$), which is the steady average velocity of charge carriers in the presence of an electric field.
    
    - $\mathbf{j}$ is defined using the number density ($n$), charge ($q$), and drift velocity ($\mathbf{v}_d$) of the carriers: $$\mathbf{j} = n q \mathbf{v}_d$$
    - If $j$ is constant over the cross-sectional area $A$, the magnitude of the total current is $I = n e v_d A$ (where $e$ is the electron charge).
2. **Equivalent Statement of Ohm's Law:** Current density is integral to an equivalent vector form of Ohm's Law, relating $\mathbf{J}$ directly to the Electric Field ($\mathbf{E}$) and material properties (resistivity $\rho$ or conductivity $\sigma$):
    
    - $\mathbf{E} = \rho \mathbf{j}$ (where $\rho$ is the resistivity).
    - $\mathbf{j} = \sigma \mathbf{E}$ (where $\sigma = 1/\rho$ is the conductivity).

This shows that the application of an electric field generates a proportional current density within the conductor, dictated by the material's conductivity ($\sigma$).
