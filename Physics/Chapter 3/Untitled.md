### 💡 I. Fundamentals of Electric Current and Charge Flow

**A. Charge and Current Definition**

1. The study shifts from **Electrostatics** (charges at rest) to **Electrodynamics** (charges in motion), focusing on Current Electricity (Chapter 3 of Class 12 Physics).
2. **Electricity** is a form of energy created when charge particles are in motion.
3. **Electric Current ($I$)** is the flow of electric charge (usually electrons or ions) through a conductor or electrolyte solution.
4. It represents the amount of electric charge ($Q$ or $\Delta Q$) passing a point in a circuit per unit of time ($t$ or $\Delta t$).
5. **Formula for Current:**
    - $I = Q/t$ (for steady current).
    - $I = \Delta Q / \Delta t$.
    - For current at time $t$ (when $\Delta t$ approaches zero), $I(t) = dQ/dt$.
6. **SI Unit of Current:** The unit is the **Ampere (A)**.
7. One ampere (1 A) is defined as **one coulomb (C) of charge passing per second (s)** (Coulomb per second). The Ampere is defined through magnetic effects.
8. Currents in nerves are in microamperes, while lightning carries currents on the order of tens of thousands of amperes.

**B. Directional Conventions (Conventional vs. Electronic)**

1. In metal wires, **electrons** are the charge carriers, moving from the negative terminal to the positive terminal.
2. **Conventional Current:** By historical convention, current flow is defined as the direction **positive charges would move**, flowing from the **positive terminal to the negative terminal**.
3. This convention was established before the discovery of electrons.
4. **Electronic Current (Electron Flow):** This is the actual physical movement of electrons, flowing from **negative to positive**.
5. The direction of electronic current is always **opposite** to the conventional current direction.
6. In solid conductors, **protons do not move**; they are tightly bound inside atomic nuclei. The current is carried solely by the moving electrons.
7. In electrolytes or plasma, both positive ions (which may include protons/positive ions) and negative ions/electrons can move.

**C. Types of Current**

1. Electric current is classified primarily into Direct Current (DC) and Alternating Current (AC).
2. **Direct Current (DC):** Flows continuously in **one constant direction**. It maintains a steady, constant voltage and has zero frequency. Sources include batteries and solar cells.
3. **Alternating Current (AC):** Periodically **reverses its direction**. The voltage varies as a sine wave, typically oscillating 50 or 60 times per second (50 or 60 Hz). AC is easy to transform to different voltages, making it efficient for long-distance transmission.
4. **Steady Current:** The current value does not change with time (constant flow).
5. **Non-Steady Current (Unsteady/Varying):** The current value changes or fluctuates with time (e.g., AC or flickering circuits).

### ⚡ II. Voltage, EMF, and Internal Resistance

**A. Potential Difference (Voltage)**

1. Potential difference ($V$) or voltage is the **energy or “push”** that causes electrons to move through a circuit.
2. Higher voltage increases the current, provided resistance is constant.
3. The unit of potential difference is the **Volt (V)**.

**B. Electromotive Force (EMF, $\epsilon$)**

1. EMF is equivalent to voltage or potential difference, but it is defined specifically for the **source (cell or battery)**.
2. EMF is the work done by the source in taking a unit positive charge from the lower potential terminal to the higher potential terminal (against the potential).
3. The formula is $\epsilon = \text{Work Done} / \text{Charge}$.
4. EMF is the potential difference between the positive and negative terminals **in an open circuit** (when no current is flowing).
5. EMF is the **maximum potential difference** of a circuit.
6. EMF is a potential difference, not a force, despite its historical name.

**C. Internal Resistance ($r$) and Terminal Voltage ($V$)**

1. **Internal Resistance ($r$)** is the resistance that a cell or battery possesses inside itself.
2. The terminal voltage ($V$) across an external resistance ($R$) is related to the EMF ($\epsilon$) and internal resistance ($r$) by:
    - **Discharging:** $V = \epsilon - I r$. Since $IR$ is a positive value, $\epsilon$ is always greater than $V$ during discharge.
    - **Charging:** $V = \epsilon + I r$.
3. The total current in a circuit with external resistance $R$ is $I = \epsilon / (R + r)$.
4. When plotting terminal voltage ($V$) (Y-axis) versus current ($I$) (X-axis) for a cell undergoing discharge, the relationship is $V = (-r) I + \epsilon$.
    - This is a straight-line equation ($y = mx + c$).
    - The y-intercept ($c$) is the **EMF ($\epsilon$)**.
    - The slope ($m$) is the **negative of the internal resistance ($-r$)**.
    - The graph slopes downwards because the slope is negative.

### 📐 III. Ohm’s Law, Resistance, and Resistivity

**A. Ohm’s Law and Resistance**

1. Ohm's Law, discovered by G.S. Ohm in 1828, states that the current ($I$) is directly proportional to the potential difference ($V$) applied across a conductor, provided **temperature and dimensions remain constant**.
2. Mathematical form: $V \propto I$, or $\mathbf{V = IR}$.
3. **Resistance ($R$)** is the constant of proportionality.
4. Resistance is a property of a substance that opposes or resists the flow of current (like circuit friction).
5. **Resistance is independent of $V$ and $I$** in the context of Ohm's Law.
6. The unit of Resistance is the **Ohm ($\Omega$)** (Volt per Ampere).

**B. Factors Determining Resistance and Resistivity**

1. Resistance ($R$) depends on the material and the conductor's dimensions.
2. **Length ($L$):** $R$ is **directly proportional** to length ($R \propto L$).
3. **Area of Cross-Section ($A$):** $R$ is **inversely proportional** to the area ($R \propto 1/A$). Thicker wires have less resistance.
4. The combined relation is $\mathbf{R = \rho L/A}$.
5. **Resistivity ($\rho$):** The constant of proportionality ($\rho$, or _rho_) is called resistivity or specific resistance.
6. Resistivity depends only on the **nature of the material** and its **temperature**, not on dimensions (L or A).
7. The SI unit of resistivity is the **Ohm meter ($\Omega$ m)**.

**C. Resistivity and Material Classification**

1. Materials are classified based on their resistivities:
    - **Conductors (Metals):** Very low resistivity, $10^{-8}$ $\Omega$ m to $10^{-6}$ $\Omega$ m.
    - **Insulators:** Very high resistivity, $10^8$ $\Omega$ m to $10^{24}$ $\Omega$ m (or more). Examples include ceramic, rubber, and plastics.
    - **Semiconductors/Alloys:** Intermediate resistivity, $10^{-4}$ $\Omega$ m to $10^{6}$ $\Omega$ m.

**D. Temperature Dependence of Resistivity/Resistance**

1. **Conductors:** Increasing temperature causes resistance and resistivity to increase.
2. The resistivity ($\rho_T$) at temperature $T$ is approximated by: $\rho_T = \rho_0 [1 + \alpha (T - T_0)]$.
3. Similarly, Resistance ($R_2$) at temperature $T_2$ is: $R_2 = R_1 [1 + \alpha (T_2 - T_1)]$.
4. $\alpha$ is the **temperature coefficient of resistivity**. For metals, $\alpha$ is positive.
5. **Semiconductors:** Their resistivity decreases with increasing temperature. This occurs because the number density of charge carriers ($n$) increases significantly, compensating for the decrease in relaxation time ($\tau$).
6. **Alloys (e.g., Nichrome):** Show a very weak temperature dependence, making them ideal for standard resistors.

**E. Limitations of Ohm’s Law (Non-Ohmic Behavior)** Ohm's Law is not always obeyed:

1. **Non-Linearity:** $V$ is not proportional to $I$ (V-I graph is not a straight line).
2. **Directional Dependence:** The relation between $V$ and $I$ depends on the sign of $V$ (e.g., in a diode, reversing $V$ does not result in the same magnitude of $I$ in the opposite direction).
3. **Non-Uniqueness:** There is more than one value of $V$ for the same current $I$ (e.g., in GaAs).

### 💨 IV. Current Density, Drift Velocity, and Mobility

**A. Current Density and Conductivity**

1. **Current Density ($\vec{J}$):** Defined as the amount of current ($I$) flowing per unit area ($A$), where the area is held normal (perpendicular) to the flow.
2. Formula: $J = I/A$.
3. Unit: **Ampere per meter squared ($A/m^2$)**.
4. Current density is a **vector quantity**.
5. When the area vector ($\vec{A}$) is at an angle ($\theta$) to the current density ($\vec{J}$), the current is given by the dot product: $I = \vec{J} \cdot \vec{A}$ or $I = J A \cos \theta$.
6. Ohm's Law in vector form relates electric field ($\vec{E}$) and current density ($\vec{J}$): $\mathbf{\vec{E} = \rho \vec{J}}$ or $\mathbf{\vec{J} = \sigma \vec{E}}$.
7. **Conductivity ($\sigma$):** The reciprocal of resistivity ($\sigma = 1/\rho$).
8. **Conductance ($G$):** The reciprocal of resistance ($G = 1/R$). Unit: $\text{Ohm}^{-1}$ or **Siemens (S)**.

**B. Drift Velocity ($v_d$) and Relaxation Time ($\tau$)**

1. In the absence of an electric field, electrons move randomly due to thermal motion, resulting in zero average velocity.
2. In the presence of an electric field, electrons accelerate but constantly collide with fixed ions.
3. **Drift Velocity ($v_d$):** The slow, constant average velocity at which electrons drift in the direction opposite to the applied electric field.
4. **Relaxation Time ($\tau$):** The average time interval between two successive collisions of an electron. A larger $\tau$ leads to higher drift velocity and less resistance.
5. **Drift Velocity Formula:** $v_d = - (e E \tau) / m$, where $e$ is the electron charge, $E$ is the electric field, and $m$ is the electron mass. The negative sign shows $v_d$ is opposite to $E$.
6. **Current-Drift Velocity Relation:** The magnitude of current ($I$) is $I = n e A v_d$, where $n$ is the electron density (number of electrons per unit volume) and $A$ is the area. $I$ is directly proportional to $v_d$.
7. **Microscopic Resistivity:** The resistance and resistivity derived from the drift velocity model are:
    - Resistance: $R = (m L) / (n e^2 \tau A)$.
    - Resistivity: $\rho = m / (n e^2 \tau)$.

**C. Mobility ($\mu$)**

1. **Mobility** measures how easily a charge carrier moves.
2. It is defined as the magnitude of the **drift velocity per unit electric field applied**.
3. Formula: $\mathbf{\mu = |v_d| / E}$. Mobility is a positive quantity.
4. Unit: $m^2 / (V s)$.
5. Mobility is related to relaxation time: $\mu = e \tau / m$.
6. If mobility is high, the current will be high.
7. Current can be written in terms of mobility: $I = n e A \mu E$.

### 🔋 V. Electrical Energy and Power

**A. Electric Power ($P$)**

1. Electric Power is the rate of doing electrical work or dissipating electrical energy.
2. Formula: $P = \text{Work Done} / \text{Time}$.
3. The unit of power is the **Watt (W)** (Joule per second).
4. Power Formulas (Ohmic Loss):
    - $\mathbf{P = V I}$
    - $\mathbf{P = I^2 R}$
    - $\mathbf{P = V^2 / R}$

**B. Heating Effect (Joule's Law)**

1. When current flows through a conductor, energy gained by the charge carriers is transferred to the atoms during collisions, causing the conductor to heat up (Heating Effect).
2. The energy (or heat, $H$) dissipated in a time interval $T$ is given by Joule's Law of Heating: $\mathbf{H = I^2 R T}$.
3. Heat is directly proportional to the square of the current ($I^2$), resistance ($R$), and time ($T$).

**C. Commercial Unit of Energy**

1. The practical unit for measuring electrical energy consumption in homes is the **kilowatt-hour ($\mathbf{kW h}$)**, often called a "unit".
2. $1 \text{ kW h}$ is a unit of energy, not power.
3. Conversion: **1 kW h = 3.6 million Joules ($\mathbf{3.6 \times 10^6 \text{ J}}$)**.

**D. Applications of Heating Effect**

1. **Electric Fuse:** Melts and breaks the circuit due to high $I^2 R T$ heating if current exceeds its rated limit (e.g., 15 A), protecting household devices.
2. **Electric Bulb:** Uses a **Tungsten** filament (high melting point) that glows due to heat. Inert gases (like Nitrogen and Argon) are used to prevent the filament from reacting with oxygen.
3. **Heating Appliances (e.g., Toasters, Geysers):** Use alloys like **Nichrome** (Nickel + Chromium) because its high resistance generates significant heating.

### 🧩 VI. Circuit Combinations (Resistors and Cells)

**A. Resistors**

1. **Series:** Current is the same; Voltage divides. Net resistance: $R_{net} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \dots$. Net resistance is high.
2. **Parallel:** Voltage is the same; Current divides. Net resistance: $1/R_{net} = 1/R_1 + 1/R_2 + 1/R_3 + \dots$. Net resistance is low. Parallel combinations are used in household wiring because voltage is kept the same for all appliances, and devices can be operated individually.

**B. Cells/Sources (EMF and Internal Resistance)**

1. **Series Combination:** (Used when cells are being utilized, e.g., remote).
    - Equivalent Internal Resistance: $r_{eq} = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + \dots$.
    - Equivalent EMF: $\epsilon_{eq} = \epsilon_1 + \epsilon_2 + \epsilon_3 + \dots$ (assuming positive to negative connection). If terminals are reversed, the corresponding EMF is subtracted.
2. **Parallel Combination:** (Used when cells are being charged, requires same voltage).
    - Equivalent Internal Resistance: $1/r_{eq} = 1/r_1 + 1/r_2 + 1/r_3 + \dots$.
    - Equivalent EMF relation: $\epsilon_{eq} / r_{eq} = \epsilon_1 / r_1 + \epsilon_2 / r_2 + \epsilon_3 / r_3 + \dots$.

### 🧮 VII. Kirchhoff’s Rules and Wheatstone Bridge

**A. Kirchhoff's Rules** Kirchhoff’s rules are used for the analysis of complex electric circuits.

1. **Junction Rule (First Law):** At any junction, the sum of currents entering the junction must equal the sum of currents leaving the junction.
    
    - **Based on:** Law of Conservation of Charge (charge does not accumulate at the junction).
2. **Loop Rule (Second Law):** The algebraic sum of changes in potential (voltage) around any closed loop must be zero.
    
    - This implies that the total potential drop must equal the total potential gain in a loop.
    - **Based on:** Law of Conservation of Energy (since potential is dependent on location, returning to the starting point means the total change must be zero).
    - **Sign Conventions:** Potential Drop ($IR$) is positive if moving in the direction of current; Potential Gain ($\epsilon$) is positive if moving from the negative terminal to the positive terminal of the source.

**B. Wheatstone Bridge**

1. The Wheatstone bridge is an arrangement of **five resistances** (four in a loop, one in the center—the galvanometer arm).
2. The **galvanometer arm (BD)** detects current; the **battery arm (AC)** connects to the source.
3. **Balancing Condition:** The bridge is balanced if the current through the galvanometer ($I_G$) is zero.
4. If the bridge is balanced, the ratio of resistances must be equal: $\mathbf{R_1 / R_2 = R_3 / R_4}$.
5. In the balanced condition, the two galvanometer terminals (B and D) are at the **same potential**.

### ❄️ VIII. Superconductivity and Meissner Effect

1. **Superconductivity:** The phenomenon where the resistance and resistivity of a material drop to approximately **zero** (complete loss of resistivity) when cooled below a certain threshold temperature.
2. **Critical Temperature ($T_C$):** The temperature at which this transition to superconductivity occurs.
3. **Meissner Effect:** When a conductor becomes a superconductor (temperature below $T_C$), it actively expels magnetic field lines, which must then pass around the superconducting material.
