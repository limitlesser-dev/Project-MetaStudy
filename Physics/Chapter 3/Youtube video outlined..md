**II. Foundational Concepts (First Half Hour)**

- **Electricity:** Defined as a form of energy generated when charge particles are in motion (due to the flow of charges).
- **Electric Current ($I$):**
    - Flow of charge.
    - Mathematically defined as the amount of charge passing a conductor per unit time (per second).
    - Formula: $\Delta Q / \Delta t$ or $dQ / dt$ (Rate of flow of charge).
    - SI Unit: Coulomb per second (C/s) or **Ampere** (A). 1 Ampere is when 1 Coulomb of charge passes in 1 second.
- **Conventional Current vs. Electronic Current:**
    - Current is a scalar quantity but has direction.
    - **Conventional Current:** Flows from positive to negative terminals, based on the historical assumption that positive charges moved.
    - **Electronic Current:** Represents the actual flow of electrons, moving from negative to positive.
    - The accepted convention is that **current always flows opposite to the direction of electron movement**.
- **Electromotive Force (EMF, $E$):**
    - Necessary to maintain continuous flow (like pumping water back to a high tank).
    - Defined as the work done by a source (cell/battery) to take a unit charge from one terminal to the other (low potential to higher potential).
    - Formula: Work Done / Charge.
    - **Distinction from Potential Difference ($V$):** EMF is defined for the entire source. $V$ is the work done per unit charge between two points in a circuit. EMF is the maximum potential difference of a circuit.
    - SI Unit: Joule per Coulomb (J/C) or **Volt** (V).

**III. Ohm's Law and Resistance**

- **Ohm's Law:** States that at **constant temperature and dimensions** (length, area), the current flowing through a conductor ($I$) is directly proportional to the potential difference ($V$) applied across its ends.
- **Formula:** $V \propto I$, which becomes $\mathbf{V = IR}$.
- **Resistance ($R$):**
    - The constant of proportionality in Ohm's Law.
    - Property of a substance that resists the flow of current (similar to friction).
    - Formula: $R = V/I$.
    - $R$ is independent of changes in $V$ and $I$.
    - SI Unit: Volt per Ampere (V/A) or **Ohm** ($\Omega$).
- **V-I Graph:**
    - Since $V$ and $I$ are directly proportional, the graph is a **straight line** starting from the origin.
    - The **slope** of the $V$ vs. $I$ graph ($V/I$) gives the **Resistance ($R$)**.
    - The slope of the $I$ vs. $V$ graph ($I/V$) gives $\mathbf{1/R}$.
- **Factors Affecting Resistance ($R$):**
    - Length ($L$): $R$ is **directly proportional** to $L$.
    - Area of Cross-Section ($A$): $R$ is **inversely proportional** to $A$. Thicker wires have lower resistance.
    - Nature of Material and Temperature.
    - Combined Formula: $\mathbf{R = \rho L/A}$.

**IV. Resistivity and Conductivity**

- **Resistivity ($\rho$):** The constant in the resistance formula $R = \rho L/A$. It represents the dependence of resistance on the nature of the material and temperature.
    - Formula: $\rho = R A / L$.
    - SI Unit: **Ohm meter** ($\Omega$m).
    - **Value Ranges based on Material:**
        - Conductors: Low resistivity ($10^{-8}$ to $10^{-4} \Omega$m).
        - Insulators: High resistivity ($10^8 \Omega$m or more).
        - Semiconductors/Alloys: Moderate resistivity ($10^{-4}$ to $10^6 \Omega$m).
- **Temperature Dependence of Resistivity (Conductors):** Increasing temperature increases resistance and resistivity.
    - Formula for Resistance Change: $\mathbf{R_2 = R_1 [1 + \alpha (T_2 - T_1)]}$.
    - Formula for Resistivity Change: $\mathbf{\rho_2 = \rho_1 [1 + \alpha (T_2 - T_1)]}$. ($\alpha$ is the temperature coefficient).
- **Conductance:** Inverse of Resistance ($1/R$). Unit: $\Omega^{-1}$ or Siemens.
- **Conductivity ($\sigma$):** Inverse of Resistivity ($1/\rho$). Unit: $\Omega^{-1}m^{-1}$.

**V. Current Density and Charge Movement**

- **Current Density ($J$):**
    - Defined as the current flowing perpendicularly per unit area.
    - Formula: $J = I/A$.
    - It is a **vector quantity**.
    - Vector Relation: Current $I = \vec{J} \cdot \vec{A}$ (dot product).
    - SI Unit: Ampere per meter squared ($A/m^2$).
- **Mechanism of Flow:**
    - **Drift Velocity ($v_d$):** The average velocity at which electrons drift toward the opposite terminal when an electric field is applied.
    - **Relaxation Time ($\tau$):** The time gap between two successive collisions of a charge particle inside the conductor.
- **Drift Velocity Derivations:**
    - $v_d$ Formula: $\mathbf{v_d = -e E \tau / m}$. (The negative sign shows $v_d$ is opposite to the electric field $E$).
    - Current-Drift Velocity Relation: $\mathbf{I = -n e A v_d}$. (Current is directly proportional to drift velocity).
- **Derivation of Ohm's Law (Most Important):** By substituting the $v_d$ formula into the current formula and using $E = V/L$, Ohm's Law ($\mathbf{V \propto I}$) is proved, showing that the proportionality constant $R$ is $\mathbf{(mL / n e^2 A \tau)}$.
- **Mobility ($\mu$):**
    - The ease with which a charge particle moves; defined as the drift velocity per unit electric field applied.
    - Formula: $\mathbf{\mu = v_d / E}$.
    - Current-Mobility Relation: $\mathbf{I = -n e A \mu E}$.

**VI. Ohmic, Non-Ohmic, and Superconductivity**

- **Ohmic Conductors:** Substances that follow Ohm's Law (V-I graph is a straight line). Example: Metals.
- **Non-Ohmic Substances:** Substances that do not follow Ohm's Law (V-I graph is non-linear). Example: Semiconductors (PN Junctions).
- **Superconductivity:** The phenomenon where resistivity ($\rho$) approaches **zero** (complete loss of resistivity) when cooled.
    - **Critical Temperature ($T_c$):** The temperature at which a substance transitions to a superconductor.
- **Meissner Effect:** The observation that a superconductor will **expel** or push away magnetic field lines rather than allowing them to pass through its interior.

**VII. Circuit Laws and Combinations**

- **Combination of Resistors:**
    - **Series:** $R_{net} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3$. Current is the same; voltage divides. High net resistance.
    - **Parallel:** $1/R_{net} = 1/R_1 + 1/R_2 + 1/R_3$. Voltage is the same; current divides. Low net resistance. Used in household circuits because voltage is constant and devices can be individually controlled.
- **Kirchhoff's Laws (KCL & KVL):**
    - **First Law (Junction Law/KCL):** The total current entering a junction equals the total current leaving it. Based on the **Law of Conservation of Charge**.
    - **Second Law (Loop Law/KVL):** The total potential drop is always equal to the total potential gain in a closed loop. Based on the **Law of Conservation of Energy**.
- **Wheatstone Bridge (W.S.B.):**
    - An arrangement of five resistances, typically used to measure unknown resistance.
    - **Balancing Condition:** If the current through the central galvanometer ($I_G$) is zero, then the ratio of adjacent resistances is equal: $\mathbf{P/Q = R/S}$.

**VIII. Cell Internal Resistance and Combinations**

- **Internal Resistance ($r$):** The resistance present within a cell or battery itself.
- **EMF-Voltage Relation (Discharging):** $\mathbf{V = E - Ir}$. This shows that terminal voltage ($V$) is always less than EMF ($E$) during discharge because of the drop $Ir$ across the internal resistance.
- **V-I Graph for Discharging Cell:** A straight line sloping downwards.
    - Slope: **$-r$** (negative internal resistance).
    - Y-Intercept: **$E$** (EMF).
- **Cell Combinations:**
    - **Series:** Used when cells are being used (e.g., remotes).
        - Net Resistance: $R_{net} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \dots$.
        - Net EMF: $E_{net} = E_1 + E_2 + E_3 + \dots$.
    - **Parallel:** Used when cells are being charged (requires same potential).
        - Net Resistance: $1/R_{net} = 1/R_1 + 1/R_2 + 1/R_3 + \dots$.
        - Net EMF: $\mathbf{E_{net} / R_{net} = E_1 / R_1 + E_2 / R_2 + E_3 / R_3 + \dots}$.

**IX. Heating Effect and Power**

- **Joule's Law of Heating:** Heat ($H$) produced when current flows through a conductor.
    - $H$ is directly proportional to the square of current ($I^2$), resistance ($R$), and time ($t$).
    - Formula: $\mathbf{H = I^2 R t}$.
- **Electric Power ($P$):** Rate of doing electric work.
    - Formula: $P = \text{Work Done} / \text{Time}$.
    - SI Unit: Joule per second (J/s) or **Watt** (W).
    - Alternative Power Formulas: $\mathbf{P = V I}$, $\mathbf{P = I^2 R}$, and $\mathbf{P = V^2 / R}$.
- **Commercial Unit of Energy:**
    - Since household energy consumption is very large in Joules, the commercial unit is used.
    - Unit: **Kilowatt hour (kWh)** (also called 1 unit).
    - Conversion: $\mathbf{1 \text{ kWh} = 36 \text{ lakh Joules}}$.
- **Applications of Heating Effect:**
    - Electric Fuse: Uses a low melting point wire (often Copper) which melts and breaks the circuit if excessive current flows, protecting devices.
    - Electric Bulb: Uses a high melting point filament (Tungsten) that glows when heated by current. Contains inert gases like Nitrogen or Argon.
    - Heating Appliances: Use alloys like **Nichrome** (Nickel + Chromium) which have very high resistance to maximize heat generation.
