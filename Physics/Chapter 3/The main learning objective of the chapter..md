Based on the comprehensive topics detailed in the provided sources, the main learning objectives for the chapter on Current Electricity focus on establishing fundamental definitions, mastering microscopic theory, applying complex circuit laws, and understanding energy dissipation.

Here are the main learning objectives derived from the sources:
### I. Foundations and Current Definition

1. **Distinguish between Electrostatics and Current Electricity:** Be able to define the transition from dealing with charges at rest (Electrostatics) to charges in motion (Current Electricity/Electro-dynamics).
2. **Define Electric Current:** Understand the definition of electric current ($I$) as the rate of flow of charge ($I = \Delta Q / \Delta t$ or $I = dQ/dt$) and recall its SI unit, the Ampere (A).
3. **Differentiate Current Types:** Distinguish between **Conventional Current** (positive to negative) and **Electronic Current** (negative to positive, direction of actual electron flow).
4. **Define EMF and Potential Difference:** Define Electromotive Force ($\mathcal{E}$) as the work done by the source per unit charge, understand that it represents the potential difference in an open circuit, and recognize it as the **maximum potential difference** of a circuit.

### II. Ohm’s Law, Resistance, and Material Properties

5. **Master Ohm's Law:** State Ohm's Law ($V \propto I$ or $V=IR$) and its primary conditions (constant temperature and dimensions).
6. **Understand Resistance and Resistivity:**
    - Define **Resistance ($R$)** as the obstruction to current flow and derive its dependence on length ($L$) and area ($A$): $R = \rho L/A$.
    - Define **Resistivity ($\rho$)** (Specific Resistance) and recall its SI unit ($\Omega \cdot m$).
    - Classify materials (conductors, insulators, semiconductors) based on their resistivity ranges and understand how resistivity depends on the nature of the material.
7. **Analyze Temperature Dependence:** Explain how temperature affects resistivity ($\rho$) and resistance ($R$) in conductors (positive $\alpha$) using the relation $R_2 = R_1[1 + \alpha (T_2 - T_1)]$ or $\rho_T = \rho_0 [1 + \alpha (T-T_0)]$.
8. **Identify Limitations:** Recognize that Ohm's law is not a fundamental law and understand the conditions under which materials are **Non-Ohmic** (V-I non-linear, dependent on sign of V, or non-unique relation).

### III. Microscopic Theory and Mobility

9. **Relate Current to Microscopic Motion:** Define and calculate **Drift Velocity ($v_d$)** and **Relaxation Time ($\tau$)** (average time between collisions).
10. **Derive Key Relations:** Be able to derive the formulas relating drift velocity to electric field ($v_d = -eE\tau/m$) and current to drift velocity ($I = nev_d A$).
11. **Prove Ohm's Law Microscopically:** Use the microscopic relations to prove $V \propto I$ and derive the microscopic formula for resistivity ($\rho = m/(ne^2\tau)$).
12. **Define Current Density and Mobility:**
    - Define **Current Density ($J$)** as current per unit area ($J=I/A$) and express Ohm's Law in vector form ($\mathbf{J} = \sigma \mathbf{E}$).
    - Define **Mobility ($\mu$)** as the magnitude of drift velocity per unit electric field ($\mu = |v_d|/E$) and relate it to relaxation time ($\mu = e\tau/m$).

### IV. Circuit Analysis and Power

13. **Analyze Resistor Combinations:** Calculate the equivalent resistance for resistors connected in **Series** ($R_{net} = \sum R_i$) and **Parallel** ($1/R_{net} = \sum 1/R_i$).
14. **Calculate Electrical Power and Energy:** Understand the concept of electric power ($P$) as the rate of doing work and use the derived formulas: $P = IV = I^2 R = V^2/R$.
15. **Apply Joule's Law and Energy Units:** Understand the Heating Effect of Current ($H = I^2 RT$) and define the commercial unit of electric energy, the **Kilowatt-hour (kWh)**, and its conversion to Joules (36 lakh Joules).
16. **Relate EMF and Internal Resistance:** Understand the concept of **Internal Resistance ($r$)** within a cell and use the relation $V = \mathcal{E} - IR$ for discharge (or $V = \mathcal{E} + IR$ for charging). Interpret the $V$ vs. $I$ graph to find $\mathcal{E}$ and $r$.
17. **Analyze Cell Combinations:** Calculate the **equivalent EMF ($\mathcal{E}_{eq}$)** and **equivalent internal resistance ($r_{eq}$)** for cells connected in series and in parallel.

### V. Complex Circuits and Kirchhoff's Laws

18. **Master Kirchhoff's Rules:** Apply both fundamental rules to complex circuits:
    - **Junction Rule (KCL):** Apply the rule that the sum of currents entering a junction equals the sum of currents leaving (based on the **Law of Conservation of Charge**).
    - **Loop Rule (KVL):** Apply the rule that the algebraic sum of changes in potential around any closed loop is zero (based on the **Law of Conservation of Energy**).
19. **Solve Complex Circuits:** Set up and solve systems of equations involving multiple currents and components using Kirchhoff's rules.
20. **Apply the Wheatstone Bridge Principle:** Understand the Wheatstone Bridge arrangement and derive and apply the **Balance Condition** ($R_2/R_1 = R_4/R_3$ or $P/Q = R/S$) when no current flows through the galvanometer arm ($I_g = 0$).
