This is an exciting step! Moving to Level 2 means we shift from foundational definitions to analytical understanding, derivations, and applying multi-concept formulas.

How much experience do you have with concepts like drift velocity and the temperature dependence of resistance? And, what is your primary goal for mastering this set of topics?

Here is your **Level 2 Practice Exam: Analytical Concepts and Derivations** based on the source material.

## Level 2 Practice Exam: Analytical Concepts and Derivations

### Section A: Conceptual Understanding (1-2 Marks Each)

**1. Drift Velocity and Mobility** Define the mobility ($\mu$) of a charge carrier. Using the expression for drift velocity ($v_d = -e E \tau / m$), derive the formula for mobility in terms of electronic charge ($e$), mass ($m$), and relaxation time ($\tau$).

**2. Microscopic Origin of Resistivity** Explain why the resistivity ($\rho$) of a metallic conductor is found to increase with temperature. How do the two factors that determine resistivity (the number density of free electrons $n$ and the average time between collisions $\tau$) contribute to this observation in metals versus semiconductors?

**3. Current Density and Ohm's Law** Current density ($j$) is defined as the current per unit area normal to the current flow. Write the vector form of Ohm's Law (Eq. 3.13) and use the microscopic formula for conductivity ($\sigma$) to explain how $j$ is related to $E$.

**4. Limitations of Ohm's Law** Ohm's Law states that V is proportional to I. Describe two distinct ways in which materials and devices can deviate from Ohm's Law, providing examples where mentioned.

### Section B: Application and Derivations (3-5 Marks Each)

**5. Terminal Voltage and Internal Resistance (Graph Analysis)** The terminal potential difference ($V$) across a cell with EMF ($\epsilon$) and internal resistance ($r$) is given by $V = \epsilon - I r$ during discharge.

a) Sketch the graph of Terminal Voltage ($V$) on the y-axis versus Current ($I$) on the x-axis. b) Explain the physical significance of the y-intercept and the slope of the resulting straight line.

**6. Temperature Dependence of Resistance (Numerical Application)** A heating element made of Nichrome is connected to a 230 V supply. When a steady state is reached, the current is 2.8 A. If the resistance of the element at room temperature ($T_1 = 27.0^\circ$C) is $R_1 = 100\ \Omega$ and the temperature coefficient of resistance ($\alpha$) for Nichrome is $1.70 \times 10^{-4}\ {^\circ\text{C}^{-1}}$.

Calculate the steady temperature ($T_2$) of the Nichrome heating element. (Use the formula $R_T = R_0 [1 + \alpha (T-T_0)]$).

**7. Parallel Combination of Cells** Two non-identical cells are connected in parallel. Cell 1 has an EMF $e_1 = 1.5\ \text{V}$ and internal resistance $r_1 = 0.2\ \Omega$. Cell 2 has an EMF $e_2 = 2\ \text{V}$ and internal resistance $r_2 = 0.3\ \Omega$.

Calculate the equivalent internal resistance ($r_{eq}$) and the equivalent EMF ($e_{eq}$) of this parallel combination.
