## Section B: Definitions and Units

**5. Define "Electromotive Force (EMF, $\epsilon$)" and explain how it relates to potential difference ($V$).**
EMF is defined as the work done per unit charge by the source in taking the charge from lower to higher potential energy. It is the potential difference between the positive and negative terminals of a source in an open circuit (when no current is flowing through the cell).
The relationship between EMF ($\epsilon$) and the terminal potential difference ($V$) across an external resistance ($R$) is $V = \epsilon - Ir$, where $I$ is the current and $r$ is the internal resistance of the cell (during discharging).

**6. Write the formula for resistivity ($\rho$) in terms of resistance ($R$), length ($L$), and cross-sectional area ($A$) of a conductor, and state the SI unit of resistivity.**
The formula for resistivity is derived from the proportionality $R \propto l/A$.
Formula: $\rho = \frac{R A}{l}$.
SI Unit: Ohm-meter ($\Omega \cdot m$).

**7. Define Conductance ($G$) and Conductivity ($\sigma$) in relation to resistance and resistivity.**
**Conductance ($G$)** is the reciprocal of resistance ($1/R$).
**Conductivity ($\sigma$)** is the reciprocal of resistivity ($1/\rho$).

## Section C: Short Application Problems

**8. A conductor has a resistance ($R$) of $20\ \Omega$ and is cut into two equal parts. If these two parts are then connected in parallel, calculate the net resistance of the parallel combination.**
*Solution Steps:*
1. Cutting the conductor into two equal parts means the length ($l$) is halved, and since resistance is proportional to length ($R \propto l$), the resistance of each part is halved.
2. $R_{part} = 20 \Omega / 2 = 10 \Omega$.
3. When two resistors are connected in parallel, the net resistance $R_{net}$ is found using: $\frac{1}{R_{net}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}$.
4. $\frac{1}{R_{net}} = \frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{10} = \frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5}$.
5. $R_{net} = 5 \Omega$.

**9. In a metallic conductor, an electric field ($E$) causes electrons to move with a steady average velocity known as drift velocity ($v_d$). How is the current density ($\mathbf{j}$) related to the drift velocity ($v_d$) and the number of free electrons per unit volume ($n$)?**
The magnitude of the current density $|\mathbf{j}|$ is defined as current per unit area ($I/A$).
The current $I$ is related to drift velocity by $I = n e A |v_d|$.
Therefore, current density $|\mathbf{j}|$ is given by:
$|\mathbf{j}| = \frac{I}{A} = n e |v_d|$.

## Section A: Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)

**1. Electric Current ($I$) is mathematically defined as the rate of flow of charge. Which formula correctly represents the average current flowing across a cross-section of a conductor over a time interval $\Delta t$?**
C) $I = \Delta Q / \Delta t$
*Rationale: Current ($I$) is the net charge ($\Delta Q$) passing per unit time ($\Delta t$) through an area.*

**2. Which of the following is the SI unit for electric resistance ($R$)?**
B) Volt per Ampere (V/A), also known as Ohm ($\Omega$).
*Rationale: Resistance ($R$) is defined by Ohm's Law as $R = V/I$. The SI unit is the ohm, denoted by $\Omega$. The unit volt per ampere is equivalent to the ohm.*

**3. Ohm's Law states that the current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference applied across its ends, provided which conditions are kept constant?**
C) Temperature and Dimensions
*Rationale: Ohm's Law requires that the temperature and dimensions (like length and cross-sectional area) of the conductor must be kept constant.*

**4. The commercial unit used to measure electric energy consumed in homes is:**
C) Kilowatt-hour
*Rationale: Kilowatt-hour is the commercial unit of energy used in homes, often referred to as "unit".*

## Section B: Definitions and Units

**5. Define "Electromotive Force (EMF, $\epsilon$)" and explain how it relates to potential difference ($V$).**
EMF ($\epsilon$) is defined as the work done per unit charge by the source in taking the charge from lower to higher potential energy. It is the potential difference between the positive and negative electrodes in an open circuit (when no current is flowing through the cell).
*Relationship:* The terminal potential difference ($V$) across an external resistance ($R$) is related to EMF ($\epsilon$) and the internal resistance ($r$) by the formula $V = \epsilon - Ir$.

**6. Write the formula for resistivity ($\rho$) in terms of resistance ($R$), length ($L$), and cross-sectional area ($A$) of a conductor, and state the SI unit of resistivity.**
*Formula:* $\rho = \frac{R A}{l}$
*SI Unit:* Ohm-meter ($\Omega \cdot m$).

**7. Define Conductance ($G$) and Conductivity ($\sigma$) in relation to resistance and resistivity.**
**Conductance ($G$)** is the reciprocal of resistance ($1/R$).
**Conductivity ($\sigma$)** is the reciprocal of resistivity ($1/\rho$).

## Section C: Short Application Problems

**8. A conductor has a resistance ($R$) of $20\ \Omega$ and is cut into two equal parts. If these two parts are then connected in parallel, calculate the net resistance of the parallel combination.**
*Principle 1 (Cutting):* Resistance is proportional to the length ($R \propto l$). When the $20 \Omega$ conductor is cut into two equal parts, each part has $R_{1} = R_{2} = 10 \Omega$.
*Principle 2 (Parallel Connection):* The net resistance ($R_{net}$) for parallel connection is given by $\frac{1}{R_{net}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}$.
$$\frac{1}{R_{net}} = \frac{1}{10 \Omega} + \frac{1}{10 \Omega} = \frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5}$$
$$R_{net} = 5 \Omega$$

**9. In a metallic conductor, an electric field ($E$) causes electrons to move with a steady average velocity known as drift velocity ($v_d$). How is the current density ($\mathbf{j}$) related to the drift velocity ($v_d$) and the number of free electrons per unit volume ($n$)?**
Current density ($j$) is defined as current per unit area ($I/A$).
The current ($I$) is related to drift velocity ($v_d$) by $I = n e A |v_d|$.
By substituting $I$ into the definition of $j$:
$$|\mathbf{j}| = \frac{I}{A} = \frac{n e A |v_d|}{A}$$
$$|\mathbf{j}| = n e |v_d|$$
