### Enhancing Understanding

For topics like Laws of Reflection, Ray Tracing Rules, TIR applications, and the functioning of the instruments, the sources repeatedly emphasize the value of hands-on observation and demonstration. To maximize comprehension, allocate brief periods (5-10 minutes) for visualizing these experiments (referred to in the sources as "Concept Under 10 Minutes" videos) where possible, as practical knowledge is considered highly beneficial alongside theory.

For instance, understanding Total Internal Reflection (TIR) becomes "better" the lower the critical angle is. Since the critical angle depends inversely on the refractive index ($\sin i_c = 1/n$), studying how materials like diamond ($n=2.42$) exhibit better TIR than glass ($n\approx 1.4$), confirms that a higher refractive index leads to enhanced TIR. This relationship is central to applications like optical fibers, where minimal loss is achieved through maximized internal reflection. Studying the theory and then viewing a demonstration (like those described using a laser in turbid water) helps solidify this complex concept.
