Based on the material provided, which focuses on Ray Optics and Optical Instruments, I have compiled a "To Do List" covering the major concepts, laws, and exercises presented in the source excerpts.

### Ray Optics and Optical Instruments: To Do List

#### I. Foundational Concepts and Laws

1. **Review the Definition of Light:** Understand that light is electromagnetic radiation in the range of approximately 400 nm to 750 nm.
2. **Internalize Basic Light Behavior:** Remember that light travels in a straight line (a ray of light) and that its speed in a vacuum is approximately $c = 3 \times 10^8 \text{ m s}^{-1}$.
3. **Master Laws of Reflection:** Recall that the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence, and the incident ray, reflected ray, and normal lie in the same plane.
4. **Master Laws of Refraction (Snell's Law):**
    - Memorize the law: $\frac{\sin i}{\sin r} = n_{21}$ (a constant ratio).
    - Understand that the incident ray, refracted ray, and the normal all lie in the same plane.
5. **Apply the Cartesian Sign Convention:**
    - Measure all distances from the pole of the mirror or the optical center of the lens.
    - Distances measured in the same direction as the incident light are positive; those measured in the opposite direction are negative.
    - Heights measured upwards (normal to the principal axis) are positive; heights measured downwards are negative.

#### II. Mirrors and Lenses: Formulas and Image Formation

1. **Study Image Formation:** Examine image formation by plane and spherical reflecting and refracting surfaces.
2. **Understand Focal Length and Radius of Curvature:** Recall that the focal length ($f$) of a spherical mirror is half the radius of curvature ($R$): $f = R/2$.
3. **Use the Mirror Equation:** Apply the equation $\frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{f}$ to solve problems involving object distance ($u$), image distance ($v$), and focal length ($f$).
4. **Calculate Linear Magnification for Mirrors:** Use the formula $m = \frac{h'}{h} = -\frac{v}{u}$.
5. **Verify Mirror Formulas:** Ensure that the mirror equation and magnification formula are valid for all cases of reflection by a spherical mirror (concave or convex), including real or virtual images.
6. **Use the Refraction Formula at a Spherical Surface:** Apply $\frac{n_2}{v} - \frac{n_1}{u} = \frac{n_2 - n_1}{R}$ to problems involving two different media ($n_1$ and $n_2$).
7. **Use the Thin Lens Formula:** Apply the equation $\frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{f}$.
8. **Use the Lens Maker's Formula:** Apply the relation $\frac{1}{f} = (\frac{n_2}{n_1} - 1) \left(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2}\right)$ to design lenses.
9. **Practice Ray Tracing:** Practice drawing ray diagrams for different positions of the object with respect to lenses and mirrors.
10. **Calculate Magnification for Lenses:** Use the formula $m = \frac{h'}{h} = \frac{v}{u}$.
11. **Analyze Lens Combinations:** Calculate the effective focal length and total power for multiple thin lenses in contact: $\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{f_1} + \frac{1}{f_2} + \dots$ and $P = P_1 + P_2 + \dots$.

#### III. Complex Phenomena and Optical Instruments

1. **Understand Total Internal Reflection (TIR):** Recognize that TIR occurs when light travels from a denser medium to a rarer medium and the angle of incidence ($i$) is greater than the critical angle ($i_c$).
2. **Calculate Critical Angle:** Use the relationship $\sin i_c = n_{21}$.
3. **Study Applications of TIR:** Understand how TIR is used in prisms (to bend light by $90^\circ$ or $180^\circ$) and in optical fibres.
4. **Study Refraction Through a Prism:** Understand the relationships for minimum deviation ($D_m$) and the prism angle ($A$): $A = r_1 + r_2$ and $D = i + e - A$. Determine the refractive index using $n_{21} = \frac{\sin[(A+D_m)/2]}{\sin[A/2]}$.
5. **Study the Simple Microscope:** Understand how a converging lens provides angular magnification, and use the magnification formula $m = 1 + (D/f)$ (for image at near point $D=25 \text{ cm}$) or $m = D/f$ (for image at infinity).
6. **Study the Compound Microscope:** Understand how the objective and eyepiece work together to achieve large magnification. Calculate total magnification using $m = m_o m_e \approx \left(\frac{L}{f_o}\right) \left(\frac{D}{f_e}\right)$.
7. **Study the Telescope (Refracting and Reflecting):** Understand that the objective has a large focal length and aperture, and the magnifying power is $m = \frac{f_o}{f_e}$ (when the final image is at infinity). Note the benefits of reflecting telescopes (no chromatic aberration, easier mechanical support).
