**Total Estimated Study Time:** The material covered is extensive, spanning multiple core chapters of optics. The estimated time allocation suggests a total focused study period of approximately 6 hours, aligning with the sources indicating the combined lecture time was intended to be between 3.5 and 4.5 hours. This time should be dedicated to understanding the concepts, drawing diagrams (which the instructor stresses should be done manually), and mastering the derivations.
