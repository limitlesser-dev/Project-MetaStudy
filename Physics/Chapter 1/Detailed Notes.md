### I. Introduction and Course Structure

The video serves as a "one shot" complete lesson on Electric Charges and Fields, incorporating Competency Based Questions.

**Course Delivery Changes (Physics):**

- The instructor previously taught physics extensively.
- This year, due to time limitations (teaching 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, paid batches, experiments, and offline classes), physics one-shots are divided into two parts:
    1. **Part 1 (Concepts and Derivations):** Includes all concepts, derivations (done by hand), and definitions.
    2. **Part 2 (Questions):** Focuses heavily on questions because the previous year's physics paper was considered difficult. This section includes MCQs, Assertion-Reason, Subjective questions, and Competency Focused Practice Questions (SFPQ), many sourced from the "Winner Series".
- The instructor combines his previous two-hour one-shot video (recorded earlier and available on Science & Fun Education) for the concept part. Students who have already seen the old one-shot can skip the first two hours but _must_ attend the question session.

### II. Fundamentals of Electric Charge and Field

#### A. Division of 12th Class Physics (Part 1)

12th Class Physics Part 1 can be broadly divided into two areas:

1. **Electrostatics:** The study of charges at **rest**.
    - Chapters 1 and 2 fall under Electrostatics.
    - Charges may be transferred or moved (like carrying water in a bucket), but they are not flowing (like water through a pipe).
2. **Electrodynamics:** The study of charges in **motion** (current flowing in a wire).
    - Chapters 3, 4, and subsequent chapters (including Magnetism, which depends on Electrodynamics) fall under this category.

#### B. Electric Charge (Q)

Charge is a fundamental property of matter.

**Definitions:**

1. A property that produces an electric field around itself.
2. A property that develops in a body due to the **unequal amount of electrons and protons**. This inequality arises from the loss or gain of electrons. (Protons are difficult to transfer as they are inside the nucleus).

**Types of Charge:**

- **Positive Charge:** Arises when a body loses electrons, making the number of protons greater than electrons (e.g., $\text{Na}^+, \text{Ca}^{2+}$).
- **Negative Charge:** Arises when a body gains electrons, making the number of electrons greater than protons (e.g., $\text{Cl}^-, \text{O}^{2-}$).

**Key Facts about Charges:**

- **Like charges** (Positive-Positive or Negative-Negative) **repel** each other.
- **Unlike charges** (Positive-Negative) **attract** each other.
- This attractive/repulsive behavior is known as the **Fundamental Law of Electrostatics**, as the exact reason _why_ this happens is unknown.
- **SI Unit:** **Coulomb**.
- **Charge on a single electron (e):** $-1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ Coulomb.
- **Charge on a single proton:** $+1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ Coulomb (same magnitude, opposite sign).
- **Conductors:** Materials with free charges that allow electricity to flow.
- **Insulators:** Materials without free charges that do not allow electricity to flow.

### III. Electrostatic Induction

**Definition:** The process in which the **redistribution of charge** takes place within a body when an electrically charged body is brought near it.

**Key Principle:** A charged body can attract an uncharged (neutral) body, but it **cannot repel** an uncharged body.

**Mechanism (Example):**

1. A positively charged body is brought near a neutral body (which has equal positive and negative charges).
2. Due to induction, the positive charged body attracts the opposite (negative) charges to the near side and repels the similar (positive) charges to the far side of the neutral body.
3. An attraction is created between the positive charge and the induced negative charge.

#### A. Gold Leaf Electroscope

The Gold Leaf Electroscope is a device used to **detect the presence of charge** on a body.

- **Mechanism:** It works based on the principle of **Electrostatic Induction**.
- **Construction:** Typically involves a metal rod connected to a conducting plate (or knob) at the top and two thin gold leaves (chosen because gold is highly malleable) at the bottom.
- **Operation:** When a charged body (e.g., positive) is brought near the knob, induction causes opposite charge (negative) to accumulate on the knob and similar charge (positive) to be pushed down to the leaves.
- Since both leaves acquire the same charge (positive), they **repel** each other, indicating the presence of charge on the test body.
- **Limitation:** It only indicates _if_ charge is present; it **does not** tell whether the charge is positive or negative. (If the test body had been negative, the leaves would have acquired negative charge and still repelled).

### IV. Basic Properties of Electric Charge

Charge follows three basic properties:

#### 1. Additivity

- Charge can be added directly, like scalars, using their magnitude and sign.
- **Total Charge ($\mathbf{Q_{Total}}$):** Sum of all individual charges, considering positive and negative signs.
- _Example:_ If charges are $-3\text{C}, +10\text{C}, +2\text{C}, -5\text{C}$, the total charge is $(-3 + 10 + 2 - 5)\text{C} = 4\text{C}$.

#### 2. Conservation

- Electric charge can **neither be created nor destroyed**; it can only be transferred from one body to another.
- The total charge of an **isolated system** remains constant.

#### 3. Quantization of Charge

- Charge is not continuous; it is **discrete** and comes in small packets (quanta).
- The minimum charge that can exist on a body is the charge of one electron ($1.6 \times 10^{-19}\text{C}$).
- Any charge ($Q$) on a body is always an **integral multiple** of the basic quantum of charge (e).
- **Formula:** $\mathbf{Q = ne}$.
    - $n$ is an integer ($\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \dots$) representing the number of electrons gained or lost.
    - If electrons are taken, $Q$ is negative; if given, $Q$ is positive.

### V. Coulomb’s Law of Electrostatics

This law governs the electrostatic force between two point charges ($q_1$ and $q_2$) separated by distance $r$. (The law is analogous to the Universal Law of Gravitation).

**Principles:**

1. The electrostatic force ($F$) is **directly proportional** to the product of the magnitudes of the charges ($\mathbf{F \propto q_1 q_2}$).
2. The electrostatic force ($F$) is **inversely proportional** to the square of the distance between the charges ($\mathbf{F \propto 1/r^2}$). (If $r$ doubles, $F$ reduces by four times).

**Formula (Magnitude):** $$ \mathbf{F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}} $$

- Where $k$ is the Electrostatic Force Constant.

**The Electrostatic Force Constant ($k$):**

- **Medium Dependent:** Unlike the gravitational constant ($G$), $k$ is **not a universal constant**; its value changes depending on the medium (air, water, vacuum) between the charges.
- **Relationship with Permittivity:** $k$ is often expressed as: $\mathbf{k = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}}$.
    - $\epsilon_0$ (Epsilon naught) is the **Permittivity of Free Space** (Vacuum).
- **Value (for Free Space/Vacuum/Air):** $\mathbf{k = 9 \times 10^9 \text{ Nm}^2\text{C}^{-2}}$.

**Full Formula (for Free Space):** $$ \mathbf{F = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}} $$ **Permittivity of Free Space ($\epsilon_0$):**

- **Value:** $\mathbf{\epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \text{ N}^{-1}\text{m}^{-2}\text{C}^2}$ (Unit is reciprocal of $k$'s unit).
- $\epsilon_0$ is also medium dependent (if the medium changes, we use $\epsilon$ instead of $\epsilon_0$).

#### A. Relative Permittivity (Dielectric Constant)

- **Definition:** The ratio of the permittivity of a medium ($\epsilon$) to the permittivity of free space ($\epsilon_0$).
- It is also called the **Dielectric Constant** ($\kappa$ or $K$).
- **Formula:** $\mathbf{\kappa = \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}}$. (This concept is very important in Chapter 2).

### VI. Electric Field (E)

#### A. Definitions and Properties

**Theoretical Definition:** The region or space around a charge up to which it can apply electrostatic force (influence) on other charges.

**Mathematical Definition:** The electrostatic **Force per Unit Test Charge**.

- **Formula:** $\mathbf{E = \frac{F}{q_0}}$.
- **SI Unit:** **Newton per Coulomb ($\text{NC}^{-1}$)**.
- **Nature:** It is a **Vector Quantity**.
- **Direction (Conventional):** Travels **from Positive Charge to Negative Charge**.

**Source Charge (q):** The charge creating the electric field. **Test Charge ($\mathbf{q_0}$):** A hypothetical charge used to measure the field.

- **Properties of Test Charge:**
    1. It must be **infinitesimally small** (vanishingly small, $q_0 \to 0$) so that its own field does not influence the source charge's field.
    2. By convention, the test charge is always assumed to be **positive**.

#### B. Electric Field due to a Point Charge (Derivation)

We can derive the formula for $E$ using Coulomb's law.

1. Force between source charge ($q$) and test charge ($q_0$) at distance $r$: $$ F = k \frac{q q_0}{r^2} $$
2. Electric Field definition: $$ E = \frac{F}{q_0} = \frac{k q q_0 / r^2}{q_0} $$
3. The test charge ($q_0$) cancels out, confirming that the electric field formula for a point charge does **not** depend on the test charge. **Formula:** $$ \mathbf{E = \frac{k q}{r^2}} \quad \text{or} \quad \mathbf{E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2}} $$

### VII. Electric Dipole and Dipole Moment

#### A. Electric Dipole

**Definition:** A system of **two equal and opposite charges** separated by a distance (often denoted as $2a$).

- The charges must have the same magnitude ($q$) but opposite signs (e.g., $+q$ and $-q$).
- The distance between them is usually represented as $2a$ (or $2l$ or $2r$) to simplify later calculations involving the center point (making the halves $a$ and $a$).

#### B. Electric Dipole Moment (P)

**Definition:** The product of **either charge** ($q$) and the **distance** between the charges ($2a$).

- **Formula:** $\mathbf{P = q \cdot 2a}$.
- **Nature:** It is a **Vector Quantity**.
- **Direction (Assumed/Conventional):** **From the Negative Charge to the Positive Charge**.
- **SI Unit:** **Coulomb meter ($\text{C m}$)** (A dash is recommended between C and m to avoid confusion with centimeter or millicoulomb).

#### C. Electric Field due to a Dipole (Short Dipole)

Derivations are done considering the dipole is short, meaning the distance $r$ to the calculation point is much greater than the separation distance $a$ ($a \ll r$).

**1. At an Axial Point (End-on Position):** The point $P$ lies along the axis of the dipole.

- The electric field is calculated by summing the fields created by $+q$ and $-q$ charges.
- **Result (Short Dipole):** $$ \mathbf{E_{axial} = \frac{-2kp}{r^3}} $$
    - The negative sign indicates the electric field direction is opposite to the dipole moment direction.

**2. At an Equitorial Point (Broadside-on Position):** The point $P$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of the dipole.

- Vector components are used. The $\sin \theta$ components cancel out, and the $\cos \theta$ components add up.
- **Result (Short Dipole):** $$ \mathbf{E_{equitorial} = \frac{kp}{r^3}} $$

**Ratio of Magnitudes:** For a short dipole, the ratio of the electric field on the axial point to the electric field on the equatorial point is $2:1$. $$ \mathbf{\frac{|E_{axial}|}{|E_{equitorial}|} = 2:1} $$

---

### VIII. Torque on an Electric Dipole ($\tau$)

When a dipole is placed in a **uniform external electric field** ($E$).

**Condition for Torque:** Torque is applied if two opposite forces have a **different line of action**.

1. **Forces on the Dipole:**
    - Force on $+q$: $F_{+q} = +qE$ (in the direction of $E$).
    - Force on $-q$: $F_{-q} = -qE$ (opposite to the direction of $E$).
2. **Net Force:** Since the forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction ($QE$ and $-QE$), the **Net Force is Zero**. This means the dipole will not undergo translational motion (it won't move forward or backward).
3. **Torque Derivation:**
    - Torque ($\tau$) = Either Force $\times$ Perpendicular Distance.
    - The perpendicular distance between the lines of action of the forces is $2a \sin \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the dipole moment ($P$) and the electric field ($E$).
    - Substituting $q \cdot 2a$ with $P$: **Formula (Magnitude):** $$ \mathbf{\tau = PE \sin \theta} $$ **Formula (Vector Form):** $$ \mathbf{\vec{\tau} = \vec{P} \times \vec{E}} $$ (Since $\sin \theta$ implies a cross product).

#### A. Special Cases (Equilibrium)

Equilibrium exists when both Net Force and Net Torque are zero.

1. **$\mathbf{\theta = 0^\circ}$:** (Dipole parallel to $E$, $P$ in direction of $E$)
    - $\sin 0^\circ = 0$. $\tau = 0$.
    - **Equilibrium Type:** **Stable Equilibrium**. (If disturbed, the dipole returns to $0^\circ$).
2. **$\mathbf{\theta = 90^\circ}$:** (Dipole perpendicular to $E$)
    - $\sin 90^\circ = 1$. $\mathbf{\tau = PE}$.
    - **Maximum Torque** is applied. (No equilibrium).
3. **$\mathbf{\theta = 180^\circ}$:** (Dipole anti-parallel to $E$, $P$ opposite to $E$)
    - $\sin 180^\circ = 0$. $\tau = 0$.
    - **Equilibrium Type:** **Unstable Equilibrium**. (Extremely sensitive position; if disturbed, it rapidly flips to stable equilibrium).

### IX. Electric Field Lines (EFLs)

EFLs are **imaginary lines** used to represent the electric field.

**Definitions:**

1. An imaginary line on which a small positive charge, if placed, would move freely.
2. An imaginary line where, if a tangent is drawn at any point, it gives the **direction of the electric field** at that point.

**Properties of Electric Field Lines:**

1. They are **continuous smooth curves** with no sudden breaks or turns (if a sudden turn occurred, there would be two tangents/two directions of E at one point, which is impossible).
2. They originate from **Positive Charge** and terminate at **Negative Charge**.
3. They **cannot form closed loops** (unlike magnetic field lines).
4. Two electric field lines **never intersect** (if they did, there would be two directions of $E$ at the intersection point).
5. They are always **perpendicular (normal)** to the surface of the charge particle or conductor.
6. Where the lines are **closer (denser)**, the electric field is **Stronger**; where they are farther apart, the field is Weak.
7. EFLs **cannot travel inside a hollow conductor**. This phenomenon is called **Electrostatic Shielding**. (E.g., safety inside a car during lightning).

#### A. Drawing Electric Field Lines

- **Positive Charge:** Lines radiate **outward** perpendicular to the surface, extending to infinity.
- **Negative Charge:** Lines converge **inward** perpendicular to the surface, coming from infinity.
- **Electric Dipole (+/-):** Lines originate from positive and terminate on negative, running perpendicular to both surfaces.
- **Like Charges (+/+):** Lines repel each other and bend outward; they do not intersect.
- **Sheet:** Lines are **uniform** and parallel (mathematically proven later).

### X. Electric Flux ($\Phi_E$) and Gauss’s Theorem

#### A. Area Vector

- For calculations involving flux, Area is treated as a **Vector Quantity**.
- **Direction for Closed Bodies (e.g., Cube, Sphere):** Area vector is always taken as **Perpendicularly Outward**.
- **Direction for Open Bodies (e.g., Sheet):** Area vector is the one that makes the **Smaller Angle** with the Electric Field ($E$).

#### B. Electric Flux ($\Phi_E$)

- **Definition:** The measure of the **number of electric field lines passing through a particular area**.
- **Formula (General):** $$ \mathbf{\Phi_E = E \cdot S = ES \cos \theta} $$
    - $\theta$ is the angle between the Electric Field ($\vec{E}$) and the Area Vector ($\vec{S}$).
    - If $E$ and $S$ are perpendicular to each other, $\Phi_E = 0$. If $E$ and $S$ are parallel ($\theta=0^\circ$), $\Phi_E = ES$.
- **Nature:** It is a **Scalar Quantity** (derived from the dot product of two vectors).
- **SI Unit:** $\text{Newton meter}^2 \text{ per Coulomb } (\text{Nm}^2\text{C}^{-1})$.

#### C. Gauss’s Theorem

Gauss's theorem provides an easier way to calculate electric flux for closed bodies.

- **Statement:** The total electric flux ($\Phi_E$) through a closed surface is equal to $\mathbf{1/\epsilon_0}$ times the **net charge enclosed** by that surface ($Q_{enclosed}$).
- **Formula:** $$ \mathbf{\Phi_E = \oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{S} = \frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\epsilon_0}} $$
    - _Proof:_ For a point charge $q$ placed inside a sphere of radius $r$, integrating $E \cdot dS$ shows that $\Phi_E = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2} \cdot (4\pi r^2) = \frac{q}{\epsilon_0}$.

**Gaussian Surface:** A hypothetical (imaginary) closed surface used as a reference to apply Gauss's theorem when the actual surface is open or irregular.

#### D. Applications of Gauss’s Law (Derivations)

**1. Coulomb’s Law from Gauss’s Law**:

- Using Gauss's Law ($\oint E \cdot dS = q/\epsilon_0$) for a point charge $q$ enclosed in a Gaussian sphere, we derive: $$ E (4\pi R^2) = q/\epsilon_0 $$
- Substituting $E=F/q_0$ and rearranging yields the familiar Coulomb's Law formula: $$ \mathbf{F = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q q_0}{R^2}} $$

**2. Electric Field due to an Infinitely Long Straight Wire:**

- **Gaussian Surface:** Cylinder.
- **Charge Density:** Linear Charge Density ($\lambda = q/l$).
- The flux from the circular ends of the cylinder is zero ($\cos 90^\circ$). Only the curved surface contributes flux.
- **Result (E vs. r):** The electric field is **inversely proportional to the distance ($r$)** from the wire. $$ \mathbf{E \propto \frac{1}{r}} $$

**3. Electric Field due to an Infinite Plane Sheet of Charge:**

- **Gaussian Surface:** Cylinder (piercing the sheet).
- **Charge Density:** Surface Charge Density ($\sigma = q/A$).
- The flux from the curved surface is zero ($\cos 90^\circ$). The flux comes only from the two circular ends.
- **Result (E vs. r):** The electric field is **Constant** and **independent of the distance ($r$)**. $$ \mathbf{E = \frac{\sigma}{2 \epsilon_0}} $$

**4. Electric Field due to a Hollow Conducting Sphere (Shell):**

- **Charge Density:** Surface Charge Density ($\sigma = q/A$).

|Location|Electric Field ($E$)|Relation to Distance ($r$)|Key Concept|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Inside** ($r < R$)|$\mathbf{E = 0}$|Zero|Electrostatic Shielding/Hollow conductor property.|
|**On the Surface** ($r = R$)|$\mathbf{E = \sigma / \epsilon_0}$|Constant|Maximum field occurs here.|
|**Outside** ($r > R$)|$\mathbf{E \propto \frac{1}{r^2}}$|Inverse Square|Decreases rapidly, like a point charge.|

### X. Practice Questions and Conceptual Points Summary

The practice questions reinforce key concepts across the chapter.

|Concept Illustrated|Question Type / Key Takeaway|Citations|
|:--|:--|:--|
|**Flux Calculation ($\mathbf{ES \cos \theta}$)**|Calculating flux through a square sheet where the electric field (E) is along the x-axis ($i$-cap) and the plane is parallel to the yz-plane. The area vector is perpendicular to the yz-plane, meaning $\theta=0^\circ$ with the E-field.||
|**Force Graphing (F vs. $\mathbf{1/r^2}$)**|Since $\mathbf{F \propto 1/r^2}$, the graph of $F$ vs. $1/r^2$ is a straight line. The magnitude of force is proportional to the product of charges ($|q_1 q_2|
|**Gauss's Law and Enclosed Charge**|Total electric flux depends only on the net charge **enclosed** by the Gaussian surface ($\mathbf{\Phi_E = Q_{enclosed} / \epsilon_0}$). Charges outside the surface do not contribute to the flux.||
|**Flux and Dipoles**|If a closed surface encloses an electric dipole (equal and opposite charges), the net enclosed charge is zero, so the total electric flux is **zero**.||
|**Quantization of Charge**|Total charge must be an integral multiple of $e$. In a system, the total charge remains conserved (Additive Property). _Example:_ If two charged spheres (3e and 5e) are combined, the total charge must be 8e. (Note: A numerical example in the source results in a net charge of 5e).||
|**Torque and Rotation**|The torque ($\tau = PE \sin \theta$) varies according to the sine function. Going from stable equilibrium ($\theta=0^\circ$) to unstable equilibrium ($\theta=180^\circ$), the torque first increases (peak at $90^\circ$) and then decreases.||
|**Equilibrium of Dipoles**|**Stable Equilibrium** is achieved at $0^\circ$, and **Unstable Equilibrium** is achieved at $180^\circ$.||
|**Net Force in Symmetric Structures**|For highly symmetric charge configurations (like a square with alternating charges) calculating the net force on a charge at the center, forces often cancel out due to symmetry, resulting in **zero Net Force**.||
|**Acceleration in E-Field**|Though force ($F=qE$) may be the same for an electron and proton in the same field, their acceleration ($a=F/m$) will be different because their masses ($m$) are different.||
|**Surface Charge Density Ratio ($\sigma$ Ratio)**|When small drops combine to form a larger drop, the volume is conserved ($V_{big} = n \cdot V_{small}$). For 64 drops, the radius of the large drop ($R$) is $4$ times the radius of the small drop ($r$). Since charge is 64 times and area ($4\pi R^2$) is $16$ times, the ratio of surface charge densities ($\sigma_{big}/\sigma_{small}$) is $\mathbf{4:1}$.||
