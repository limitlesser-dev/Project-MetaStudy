Excellent. Thank you for providing the documentation. It allows for a much more precise and visually detailed representation of chemical concepts. I have reviewed the syntax reference and can now apply its advanced features to our lesson.

Let's revisit some key topics from our discussion on Haloalkanes and Haloarenes, but this time, we will use the full capabilities of Mathpix Markdown to illustrate them as you would see in a modern digital textbook.

### **Advanced Lesson: A Deeper Dive into Haloalkane Chemistry**

#### **1. Visualizing the $S_N2$ Mechanism with Stereochemistry**

Previously, I mentioned that the $S_N2$ reaction results in an "inversion of configuration." Let's visualize this precisely using a chiral molecule, (R)-2-Bromobutane. We will use SMILES notation to generate the exact 3D structures.

The reaction is the displacement of bromide by an iodide ion:
$\chem{I- + (R)-CH3CH(Br)CH2CH3 -> (S)-CH3CH(I)CH2CH3 + Br-}$

Notice the reactant and product molecules below. The reactant, (R)-2-Bromobutane, has the bromine atom pointing towards us (a wedge). The nucleophile ($I^-$) can only perform a **backside attack**, approaching from the side opposite the bulky bromine atom.

This forces the three other groups (hydrogen, methyl, and ethyl) to "flip over," resulting in the product, (S)-2-Iodobutane, where the iodine atom now points away from us (a dash). This is the **inversion of configuration**.

**The Full Reaction:**

$\chem[smiles="[I-].C[C@H](Br)CC"] \quad \longrightarrow \quad \chem[smiles="C[C@@H](I)CC.[Br-]"]$
*(Reactant: (R)-2-Bromobutane)* \quad\quad\quad *(Product: (S)-2-Iodobutane)*

This level of detail makes the concept of inversion tangible and unambiguous.

#### **2. Understanding Haloarene Stability with Resonance Structures**

I stated that haloarenes are unreactive towards nucleophilic substitution due to the C-X bond having a "partial double-bond character." Let's draw the actual Lewis structures to prove it.

Here is chlorobenzene, with the three lone pairs of electrons shown on the chlorine atom:
\chem{C6H5Cl}

The lone pairs on the chlorine are adjacent to the $\pi$-system of the ring. They can delocalize into the ring, forming several resonance structures. Here is the most significant one:

\chem{C6H5Cl <=> [Cl+]=C6H5-}

In this resonance structure, you can clearly see:
1.  A **double bond** exists between the carbon and the chlorine.
2.  A **positive formal charge** develops on the chlorine atom.
3.  A **negative formal charge** (a lone pair) develops on the *ortho* carbon atom of the ring.

Since the real molecule is a hybrid of all its resonance structures, the C-Cl bond is not a pure single bond; it has significant double-bond character. This makes it much stronger and harder to break compared to the pure C-Cl single bond in a haloalkane, thus explaining the low reactivity.

#### **3. Writing Complete Reactions: The Elimination of 2-Bromobutane**

Let's revisit Saytzeff's rule. We can write the full reaction showing not just the reactants and products, but also the specific reagents, solvent, and conditions required.

The reaction is the dehydrobromination of 2-bromobutane using a strong base in an alcohol solvent, with heat.

$\chem{CH3-CH(Br)-CH2-CH3 ->[\text{Potassium Hydroxide}][\text{Ethanol}, \Delta] \underset{\text{Saytzeff Product (Major)}}{CH3-CH=CH-CH3} + \underset{\text{Hofmann Product (Minor)}}{CH2=CH-CH2-CH3}}$

The notation above the arrow clearly specifies the conditions:
*   **Base:** Potassium Hydroxide ($KOH$)
*   **Solvent:** Ethanol ($CH_3CH_2OH$)
*   **Condition:** Heat ($\Delta$)

This is the standard, professional way to denote a chemical transformation, and it immediately tells a chemist that this is an **elimination reaction**, not a substitution. The major product is the more stable, more substituted alkene (But-2-ene), as predicted by Saytzeff's rule.

This syntax allows for a much more accurate and informative presentation. Please feel free to ask me to detail any other reaction or concept from the chapter, and I will be happy to illustrate it with this level of precision.
