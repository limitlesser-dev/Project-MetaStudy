## Core Concepts

### 1. [[Electrostatics vs. Electrodynamics]]

12th-grade Part 1 Physics is broadly divided into two main branches:

- **[[Electrostatics]]**:
    
    - The study of **charges at rest**.
    - Covers the first two chapters of the syllabus.
    - While charges can be transferred or moved (like carrying a bucket of water), they do not "flow" continuously (like water in a pipe).
- **[[Electrodynamics]]**:
    
    - The study of **charges in motion**, which constitutes an [[electric current]].
    - Covers chapters from the third chapter onwards, including magnetism, which is related to moving charges.

### 2. [[Electric Charge]]

An electric charge is a fundamental property of matter that can be defined in multiple ways.

#### **Defining Electric Charge**

- **Definition 1:** A property that develops in a body due to an unequal number of electrons and protons.
    - **Positive Charge**: Occurs when a body loses electrons, resulting in more protons than electrons (e.g., $Na^{+}$, $Ca^{2+}$).
    - **Negative Charge**: Occurs when a body gains electrons, resulting in more electrons than protons (e.g., $Cl^{-}$, $O^{2-}$).
    - The transfer typically involves electrons because protons are tightly bound within the nucleus and are difficult to move.
- **Definition 2:** A property of a substance that produces an [[electric field]] around it.

#### **Properties of Electric Charge**

- **SI Unit**: Coulomb (C).
- **Charge on an electron**: $-1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$.
- **Charge on a proton**: $+1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$.

#### **Fundamental Law of Electrostatics**

- **Like charges repel** (e.g., positive-positive, negative-negative).
- **Unlike charges attract** (e.g., positive-negative).
- The exact reason for this behavior is unknown, which is why it is called a "fundamental" law.

### 3. [[Conductors and Insulators]]

- **[[Conductors]]**: Materials with free charges that allow electricity to flow through them.
- **[[Insulators]]**: Materials without free charges that do not allow electricity to flow.

---

### 4. [[Electrostatic Induction]]

**Electrostatic induction** is the redistribution of charge within an uncharged body when a charged body is brought near it, without direct contact.

> [!question] Can a charged body attract an uncharged body? **Yes**, a charged body can attract a neutral (uncharged) body through induction, but it **cannot repel** it.

#### **Mechanism:**

1. When a positively charged rod is brought near a neutral body, it attracts the electrons and repels the positive nuclei within that body.
2. This creates a temporary separation of charges. The side of the neutral body closer to the rod becomes negatively charged, and the farther side becomes positively charged.
3. Because the attractive force (between the rod's positive charge and the body's induced negative charge) acts over a shorter distance than the repulsive force, there is a **net attractive force**. This is the principle behind a charged scale picking up paper bits.

#### **[[Gold Leaf Electroscope]]**

- **Purpose**: A device used to detect the presence of charge on a body. It cannot determine the polarity (positive or negative) of the charge.
- **Principle**: It operates on the principle of [[electrostatic induction]].
- **Working**:
    1. When a charged object is brought near the metal top, charges are induced in the device.
    2. Like charges are repelled down the metal rod to the thin gold (or aluminum) leaves.
    3. Since both leaves acquire the same charge, they repel each other and diverge.
    4. The divergence of the leaves indicates that the object is charged.
- **Construction**: It consists of a metal rod with two thin, light leaves (originally gold for malleability, but aluminum is a common substitute) enclosed in a transparent, insulating container.

### 5. [[Basic Properties of Electric Charge]]

1. **[[Additivity of Charge]]**:
    
    - The total charge of a system is the algebraic sum of all individual charges, taking their signs into account.
    - Example: A system with charges -3 C, +10 C, +2 C, and -5 C has a total charge of $(-3 + 10 + 2 - 5) = +4 \text{ C}$.
2. **[[Conservation of Charge]]**:
    
    - The total charge of an isolated system remains constant.
    - Charge can neither be created nor destroyed; it can only be transferred from one body to another.
3. **[[Quantization of Charge]]**:
    
    - This is a very important property for one-mark questions.
    - Electric charge is not continuous but exists in discrete packets. It is always an **integral multiple** of the basic unit of charge, which is the charge of a single electron ($e$).
    - A body cannot have a random amount of charge; it must be a multiple of $e$.
    - **Formula**: $q = ne$
        - $q$ is the total charge.
        - $n$ is an integer ($n = \pm1, \pm2, \pm3, ...$).
        - $e$ is the elementary charge ($1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$).

### 6. [[Coulomb's Law]]

Coulomb's Law describes the electrostatic force between two point charges.

> [!law] The electrostatic force between two point charges is:
> 
> 1. **Directly proportional** to the product of the magnitudes of the charges ($q_1 q_2$).
> 2. **Inversely proportional** to the square of the distance ($r^2$) between them.

- **Formula**: $F = k \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}$
    
    - Where $k$ is the **electrostatic force constant**.
    - The value of $k$ is **medium-dependent**.
    - For free space (vacuum or air), $k = 9 \times 10^9 \text{ Nm}^2\text{C}^{-2}$.
- **Permittivity of Free Space ($\epsilon_0$)**:
    
    - The constant $k$ is more fundamentally expressed as: $k = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$.
    - $\epsilon_0$ is the **permittivity of free space**.
    - For free space, $\epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \text{ C}^2\text{N}^{-1}\text{m}^{-2}$.
    - The full formula for force in free space is: $F = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}$.
- **[[Relative Permittivity (Dielectric Constant)]] ($\kappa$ or $K$)**:
    
    - It is the ratio of the permittivity of a medium ($\epsilon$) to the permittivity of free space ($\epsilon_0$).
    - **Formula**: $\kappa = \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}$.
    - This concept is crucial in the next chapter.

### 7. [[Electric Field]]

The electric field is the region around a charge where its electrostatic influence can be felt.

- **Theoretical Definition**: The space around a charge where it can exert an electrostatic force on other charges.
- **Mathematical Definition**: The electrostatic force experienced per unit positive test charge.
    - **Formula**: $\vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}}{q_0}$.
        - $\vec{E}$ is the electric field.
        - $\vec{F}$ is the force on the test charge.
        - $q_0$ is the **test charge**.

#### **Properties of a [[Test Charge]] ($q_0$)**

1. **Vanishingly Small**: Its magnitude must be infinitesimally small ($q_0 \to 0$) to avoid altering the electric field of the source charge it is meant to measure.
2. **Positive by Convention**: The test charge is conventionally considered positive to ensure universal consistency in the direction of the electric field.

#### **Electric Field Properties**

- **SI Unit**: Newton per Coulomb (N/C).
- **Vector Quantity**: It has both magnitude and direction.
- **Direction**: Conventionally defined as directed **from a positive charge to a negative charge**.

#### **Electric Field Due to a Point Charge**

- **Derivation**: By combining $F = k \frac{q q_0}{r^2}$ and $E = \frac{F}{q_0}$, the dependence on the test charge $q_0$ cancels out.
- **Formula**: $E = k \frac{q}{r^2}$ or $E = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2}$.
- The electric field from a point charge depends only on the source charge $q$ and the distance $r$.

### 8. [[Electric Dipole]]

An electric dipole is a system of two equal and opposite charges separated by a small distance.

- **System**: A pair of charges, $+q$ and $-q$, separated by a distance $2a$.
    - The distance is taken as $2a$ to simplify calculations by making the distance from the center to each charge equal to $a$.

#### **[[Electric Dipole Moment]] ($\vec{p}$)**

- **Definition**: The product of the magnitude of either charge and the distance between them.
- **Formula**: $p = q \times 2a$.
- **Vector Quantity**: Its direction is conventionally from the **negative charge to the positive charge**.
- **SI Unit**: Coulomb-meter (C·m).

#### **Electric Field of a Dipole**

1. **On the [[Axial Point]]**:
    - For a short dipole (where $a \ll r$), the electric field is: $\vec{E}_{\text{axial}} = \frac{-2k\vec{p}}{r^3}$.
2. **On the [[Equatorial Point]]**:
    - For a short dipole, the electric field is: $E_{\text{equatorial}} = \frac{kp}{r^3}$ (magnitude).

> [!summary] Relationship for a Short Dipole The magnitude of the electric field at the axial point is **twice** the magnitude of the electric field at the equatorial point for the same distance $r$. **$|E_{\text{axial}}|:|E_{\text{equatorial}}| = 2:1$**.

### 9. [[Torque on a Dipole in a Uniform Electric Field]]

When an electric dipole is placed in a uniform external electric field, it experiences a torque that tends to align it with the field.

- The forces on the $+q$ and $-q$ charges are equal in magnitude ($F = qE$) but opposite in direction.
    
- The **net force** on the dipole is **zero**, so there is no translational motion.
    
- However, because the forces have different lines of action, they create a turning effect, or **torque**.
    
- **Formula**: $\tau = pE \sin(\theta)$.
    
    - $\tau$ (tau) is the torque.
    - $p$ is the dipole moment.
    - $E$ is the electric field strength.
    - $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{p}$ and $\vec{E}$.
- **Vector Form**: $\vec{\tau} = \vec{p} \times \vec{E}$ (cross product).
    

#### **Special Cases for Torque**

- **$\theta = 0^\circ$ (Stable Equilibrium)**:
    - $\tau = 0$. The dipole is aligned with the field.
    - If displaced slightly, it returns to this position, hence it is in **stable equilibrium**.
- **$\theta = 90^\circ$**:
    - $\tau = pE$ (**Maximum torque**).
    - The dipole is perpendicular to the field.
- **$\theta = 180^\circ$ (Unstable Equilibrium)**:
    - $\tau = 0$. The dipole is anti-aligned with the field.
    - If displaced slightly, it will flip to align with the field and will not return to its original position, hence it is in **unstable equilibrium**.

### 10. [[Electric Field Lines]]

Electric field lines are imaginary curves drawn to visualize the direction and strength of an electric field.

- **Definition**: A line drawn such that the tangent at any point on it gives the direction of the electric field at that point.

#### **Properties of Electric Field Lines**

1. They are **continuous smooth curves** without breaks.
2. They **start from a positive charge** and **end on a negative charge**. They do not form closed loops.
3. The **tangent** at any point gives the direction of the electric field.
4. **No two field lines can intersect**. If they did, there would be two directions of the electric field at the point of intersection, which is impossible.
5. They are always **perpendicular (normal)** to the surface of a charged conductor.
6. The **density** of field lines represents the field's strength. Closer lines indicate a stronger field; farther lines indicate a weaker field.
7. **[[Electrostatic Shielding]]**: Electric field lines **do not enter the interior of a hollow conductor**. The electric field inside a hollow conductor is zero. This is why sitting inside a car during a lightning storm is safe.

#### **Patterns of Electric Field Lines**

- **Positive Point Charge**: Radiating outwards perpendicularly to infinity.
- **Negative Point Charge**: Radiating inwards perpendicularly from infinity.
- **Electric Dipole**: Lines originate from the positive charge and terminate on the negative charge, curving between them.
- **Two Like Charges**: Lines from both charges repel each other and bend away.
- **Charged Sheet**: Uniform, parallel, and equally spaced straight lines perpendicular to the sheet.

### 11. [[Area Vector & Electric Flux]]

#### **[[Area Vector]]**

- For calculations involving flux, area is treated as a **vector quantity**.
- **Direction**:
    - For a **closed surface** (like a cube or sphere), the area vector is always directed **perpendicularly outwards**.
    - For an **open surface**, the direction is perpendicular to the surface, chosen to make a smaller angle with the electric field.

#### **Electric Flux ($\ Phi_E$)**

- **Definition**: A measure of the total number of electric field lines passing perpendicularly through a given area.
- **Formula**: $\Phi_E = \vec{E} \cdot \vec{S} = ES \cos(\theta)$.
    - $\vec{E}$ is the electric field.
    - $\vec{S}$ is the area vector.
    - $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{S}$.
- **SI Unit**: Newton meter squared per Coulomb ($\text{Nm}^2\text{C}^{-1}$).
- **Scalar Quantity**: It is the result of a dot product.

### 12. [[Gauss's Law]]

Gauss's Law provides a powerful and often simpler method for calculating the electric flux through a closed surface.

> [!law] The total electric flux through any closed surface is equal to $\frac{1}{\epsilon_0}$ times the net charge ($q_{\text{enclosed}}$) enclosed by that surface.

- **Formula**: $\Phi_{\text{total}} = \oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{S} = \frac{q_{\text{enclosed}}}{\epsilon_0}$.
- This law is only applicable to **closed surfaces**.

#### **[[Gaussian Surface]]**

- An imaginary closed surface constructed to apply Gauss's Law.
- It should be chosen symmetrically to simplify the calculation of the electric field.
    - For a line of charge (wire), a cylinder is used.
    - For a sheet of charge, a cylinder or cuboid is used.
    - For a spherical charge distribution, a concentric sphere is used.

#### **Applications of Gauss's Law**

1. **Deriving Coulomb's Law**: Gauss's law can be used to derive Coulomb's law.
2. **Field due to an infinite long wire**: $E = \frac{\lambda}{2\pi\epsilon_0 r}$ where $\lambda$ is the linear charge density. This shows $E \propto \frac{1}{r}$.
3. **Field due to an infinite plane sheet**: $E = \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0}$ where $\sigma$ is the surface charge density. The field is constant and independent of distance.
4. **Field due to a spherical shell** (hollow conductor):
    - **Outside** ($r > R$): $E = k \frac{q}{r^2}$ (acts like a point charge at the center). $E \propto \frac{1}{r^2}$.
    - **On the surface** ($r = R$): $E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0}$ (Maximum).
    - **Inside** ($r < R$): $E = 0$ (due to electrostatic shielding).
