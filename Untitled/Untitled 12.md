## 🧪 Chemistry Concepts Explained

### ❓ Q.5: How much urea is in the solution?



**Here's what we know:**
*   **Molarity (M):** How strong the drink is. It's given as 1/40.
*   **Volume of Solution (V):** How much drink you want to make. It's 250 ml.
*   **Molar Mass of Urea (MB):** How heavy one "piece" (mole) of urea powder is. It's 60 grams for each piece.
*   **Weight of Urea (WB):** This is what we want to find out!

**The Magic Formula:**
We use a special formula that connects all these things:

$$ M = \frac{W_B \times 1000}{M_B \times V} $$

Where:
*   $M$ = Molarity
*   $W_B$ = Weight of the substance you're dissolving (urea)
*   $M_B$ = Molar mass of the substance (urea)
*   $V$ = Volume of the whole drink (solution) in milliliters

**Let's put in our numbers:**
We have $M = 1/40$, $M_B = 60$, and $V = 250$. We need to find $W_B$.

$$ \frac{1}{40} = \frac{W_B \times 1000}{60 \times 250} $$

First, let's calculate the bottom part on the right side:
$60 \times 250 = 15000$

Now the formula looks like this:
$$ \frac{1}{40} = \frac{W_B \times 1000}{15000} $$

Let's simplify the right side a bit by dividing 1000 by 15000:
$$ \frac{1000}{15000} = \frac{1}{15} $$

So,
$$ \frac{1}{40} = \frac{W_B}{15} $$

To find $W_B$, we can multiply both sides by 15:
$$ W_B = \frac{1}{40} \times 15 $$
$$ W_B = \frac{15}{40} $$

Now, let's simplify the fraction $\frac{15}{40}$ by dividing both numbers by 5:
$$ W_B = \frac{3}{8} $$

**Answer:** You need $\frac{3}{8}$ grams of urea.

### ❓ Q.6: How much of each "candy" is in the mix?

Imagine you have a bag with three types of candies: Sour (acetic acid), Sweet (ethanol), and Gummy (water). You know the weight of each type of candy. You want to find out what fraction of *all* the candies belongs to each type. This fraction is called **mole fraction**.

First, we need to know how many "pieces" (moles) of each candy we have. To do that, we need their weight and the weight of one "piece" (molar mass).

**Here's what we know (Given in the notes):**
*   **Acetic Acid:**
    *   Weight ($W_A$) = 30 grams
    *   Molar Mass ($M_A$) = 60 grams/mole
*   **Ethanol:**
    *   Weight ($W_B$) = 30 grams
    *   Molar Mass ($M_B$) = 46 grams/mole
*   **Water:**
    *   Weight ($W_C$) = 40 grams
    *   Molar Mass ($M_C$) = 18 grams/mole

**Step 1: Find the "pieces" (moles) of each candy.**
The formula for moles is:
$$ \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Weight}}{\text{Molar Mass}} $$

*   **Moles of Acetic Acid ($n_A$):**
    $$ n_A = \frac{W_A}{M_A} = \frac{30}{60} = 0.5 \text{ moles} $$
*   **Moles of Ethanol ($n_B$):**
    $$ n_B = \frac{W_B}{M_B} = \frac{30}{46} \approx 0.65 \text{ moles} $$
*   **Moles of Water ($n_C$):**
    $$ n_C = \frac{W_C}{M_C} = \frac{40}{18} \approx 2.22 \text{ moles} $$

**Step 2: Find the total "pieces" (total moles) of all candies.**
$$ \text{Total Moles} (n_{total}) = n_A + n_B + n_C $$
$$ n_{total} = 0.5 + 0.65 + 2.22 = 3.37 \text{ moles} $$

**Step 3: Find the "fraction" (mole fraction) for each candy.**
The formula for mole fraction ($X$) of a component is:
$$ X_{\text{component}} = \frac{\text{Moles of component}}{\text{Total Moles}} $$

*   **Mole Fraction of Acetic Acid ($X_A$):**
    $$ X_A = \frac{n_A}{n_{total}} = \frac{0.5}{3.37} \approx 0.14 $$
*   **Mole Fraction of Ethanol ($X_B$):**
    $$ X_B = \frac{n_B}{n_{total}} = \frac{0.65}{3.37} \approx 0.19 $$
*   **Mole Fraction of Water ($X_C$):
    $$ X_C = \frac{n_C}{n_{total}} = \frac{2.22}{3.37} \approx 0.65 $$

**Answer:**
*   The mole fraction of acetic acid is approximately 0.14.
*   The mole fraction of ethanol is approximately 0.19.
*   The mole fraction of water is approximately 0.65.

### ❓ Q.7: Is pure water's strength always the same? (Molarity and Molality)

Molarity and molality are two ways to describe how "concentrated" a solution is. But what if it's just pure water? Let's see!

**Here's what we know about pure water:**
*   If we take 1000 ml (which is 1 liter) of pure water, it weighs about 1000 grams.
*   The molar mass of water ($H_2O$) is 18 grams/mole (because Hydrogen is 1 and Oxygen is 16, so $2 \times 1 + 16 = 18$).

**Let's calculate Molarity (M):**
Molarity is about "moles of solute per liter of solution." But for pure water, water *is* the solvent, and usually we don't think of it as a solute in itself unless we're mixing it with something else.
However, if we consider pure water as the "solution" and we want to know the concentration of water in itself:

1.  **Moles of water ($n_{H_2O}$):**
    $$ n_{H_2O} = \frac{\text{Mass of water}}{\text{Molar mass of water}} = \frac{1000 \text{ g}}{18 \text{ g/mol}} \approx 55.56 \text{ moles} $$
2.  **Volume of solution:** 1000 ml = 1 Liter.

So, **Molarity (M)** of pure water:
$$ M = \frac{\text{Moles of water}}{\text{Volume of solution (L)}} = \frac{55.56 \text{ moles}}{1 \text{ L}} = 55.56 \text{ M} $$

**Now let's calculate Molality (m):**
Molality is about "moles of solute per kilogram of *solvent*." Again, for pure water, water *is* the solvent.

1.  **Moles of water ($n_{H_2O}$):** Approximately 55.56 moles (calculated above).
2.  **Mass of solvent:** If we consider 1000 grams of water, then the mass of the solvent is 1000 grams = 1 kg.

So, **Molality (m)** of pure water:
$$ m = \frac{\text{Moles of water}}{\text{Mass of solvent (kg)}} = \frac{55.56 \text{ moles}}{1 \text{ kg}} = 55.56 \text{ m} $$

**Conclusion:**
For pure water, both its molarity and molality are approximately **55.56**. So, they are equal to each other!

### ❓ Q.8: What are "Colligative Properties"?

Imagine you have a glass of water. If you add just a little bit of sugar, some things about the water change. For example, it might boil at a slightly higher temperature or freeze at a slightly lower temperature.

**Colligative properties** are super special because they only care about:
*   **How many** tiny sugar particles you added.
*   **Not what kind** of sugar particles they are (red, blue, big, small – it doesn't matter!).
*   **Not what kind** of water you're using (pure water, salty water – for the solvent).

It's like counting how many people are in a room. The colligative properties don't care if they are tall, short, boys, or girls; they just care about the *number* of people.

**Here are some examples of these special properties:**
1.  **Relative Lowering of Vapour Pressure:** How much the "steaminess" of the water goes down.
2.  **Elevation of Boiling Point:** How much the water needs to get hotter before it boils.
3.  **Depression of Freezing Point:** How much colder the water needs to get before it freezes.
4.  **Osmotic Pressure:** A special "push" related to water moving through a filter.

### ❓ Q.9: Explaining Vapour Pressure and its Lowering

**i) Vapour Pressure:**
Imagine you have a pot of water with a lid on it. Even if the water isn't boiling, some tiny water particles always try to escape into the air above the water (they turn into a gas called vapor). These vapor particles bounce around and push against the lid.
The "push" or pressure created by these vapor particles when they are in a balanced state (equilibrium) with the liquid is called **Vapour Pressure**. It's like the steam pushing up the lid slightly.

**ii) Lowering of Vapour Pressure:**
Now, imagine you add some salt to that water in the pot. The salt particles take up some space on the surface of the water. This means there are fewer water particles directly on the surface that can escape and turn into vapor.
Because fewer water particles can escape, there will be less vapor, and thus, less "push" against the lid. So, the vapor pressure goes down. This decrease in vapor pressure when you add something non-volatile (something that doesn't easily turn into vapor, like salt) to a liquid is called **Lowering of Vapour Pressure**.

If:
*   $P_A^\circ$ = Vapour pressure of the pure liquid (solvent, like pure water)
*   $P_s$ = Vapour pressure of the solution (water with salt)

Then, the **lowering of vapour pressure** is:
$$ \text{Lowering of Vapour Pressure} = P_A^\circ - P_s $$

### ❓ Q.10: What is Raoult's Law?

**Raoult's Law** is a rule that describes how adding something to a liquid changes its vapor pressure. It says:

"When you add a substance that doesn't easily turn into gas (a non-volatile solute) to a liquid, the vapor pressure of the liquid will decrease. How much it decreases depends on how much of the added substance is present."

More precisely, the "relative lowering" of the vapor pressure is equal to the **mole fraction** of the solute (the substance you added).

**Mathematical Expression:**
If:
*   $P_A^\circ$ = Vapour pressure of the pure liquid (solvent)
*   $P_s$ = Vapour pressure of the solution
*   $X_B$ = Mole fraction of the solute (the substance you added)

Then, Raoult's Law can be written as:
$$ \frac{P_A^\circ - P_s}{P_A^\circ} = X_B $$
The term $\frac{P_A^\circ - P_s}{P_A^\circ}$ is called the **relative lowering of vapour pressure**.

**Why is it a Colligative Property?**
Remember, a colligative property only cares about the *number* of particles, not what they are.

*   In the formula $\frac{P_A^\circ - P_s}{P_A^\circ} = X_B$:
*   $X_B$ (mole fraction of solute) is calculated as:
    $$ X_B = \frac{\text{Moles of Solute}}{\text{Total Moles (Solute + Solvent)}} $$
*   This formula for $X_B$ clearly shows that it only depends on the *number* of moles (which is related to the number of particles) of the solute and solvent. It doesn't ask about the size, shape, or chemical identity of the solute particles.
*   Since the relative lowering of vapor pressure ($ \frac{P_A^\circ - P_s}{P_A^\circ} $) is *equal* to the mole fraction of the solute ($X_B$), it means it also only depends on the *number* of solute particles.
*   Therefore, **relative lowering of vapor pressure is a colligative property**.

### ❓ Q.11: Finding the "weight of one piece" (Molar Mass) using Raoult's Law

We can use Raoult's Law to figure out the molar mass of an unknown substance. Imagine you add a mystery powder to water, and you measure how much the water's "steaminess" (vapor pressure) goes down. Raoult's Law helps you work backward to find the weight of one "piece" (molar mass) of that mystery powder.

**Here's the idea:**
1.  We know Raoult's Law: $ \frac{P_A^\circ - P_s}{P_A^\circ} = X_B $
2.  We also know the mole fraction of the solute ($X_B$) is:
    $$ X_B = \frac{n_B}{n_A + n_B} $$
    Where:
    *   $n_B$ = Moles of solute
    *   $n_A$ = Moles of solvent

3.  For very dilute solutions (when there's only a little bit of solute), $n_B$ is much smaller than $n_A$, so $n_A + n_B$ is almost the same as $n_A$.
    So, $ X_B \approx \frac{n_B}{n_A} $

4.  We know that moles can be found using:
    $$ n_B = \frac{W_B}{M_B} \quad \text{(Weight of solute / Molar mass of solute)} $$
    $$ n_A = \frac{W_A}{M_A} \quad \text{(Weight of solvent / Molar mass of solvent)} $$

5.  Now, substitute these into the approximate Raoult's Law equation:
    $$ \frac{P_A^\circ - P_s}{P_A^\circ} = \frac{W_B/M_B}{W_A/M_A} $$

6.  To find the molar mass of the solute ($M_B$), we can rearrange this equation:
    $$ M_B = \frac{W_B \times M_A \times P_A^\circ}{(P_A^\circ - P_s) \times W_A} $$

This formula helps you calculate the molar mass ($M_B$) of the non-volatile solute if you know all the other values (weights, molar mass of solvent, and vapor pressures).

### ❓ Q.12: Let's calculate the Molar Mass of Urea!

This is a practice problem for the idea we just learned (Q.11).

**Here's what we know:**
*   Weight of urea ($W_B$) = 6 grams
*   Weight of water ($W_A$) = 90 grams
*   Vapour pressure of the solution ($P_s$) = 190 mm Hg
*   Vapour pressure of pure water ($P_A^\circ$) = 200 mm Hg
*   Molar mass of water ($M_A$) = 18 grams/mole (we know this from Q.7)

**We want to find:** Molar mass of urea ($M_B$).

**Using the formula from Q.11:**
$$ M_B = \frac{W_B \times M_A \times P_A^\circ}{(P_A^\circ - P_s) \times W_A} $$

**Let's plug in the numbers:**
$$ M_B = \frac{6 \text{ g} \times 18 \text{ g/mol} \times 200 \text{ mm Hg}}{(200 \text{ mm Hg} - 190 \text{ mm Hg}) \times 90 \text{ g}} $$

First, calculate $(P_A^\circ - P_s)$:
$200 - 190 = 10 \text{ mm Hg}$

Now, let's put that back in:
$$ M_B = \frac{6 \times 18 \times 200}{10 \times 90} $$

Calculate the top part: $6 \times 18 \times 200 = 21600$
Calculate the bottom part: $10 \times 90 = 900$

So,
$$ M_B = \frac{21600}{900} $$
$$ M_B = 24 \text{ g/mol} $$

Wait, the notes show 60 g/mol for urea and the example calculation comes to 60. Let's recheck the calculation from the notes.
The notes formula: $ \frac{W_B \times M_A}{M_B \times W_A} = \frac{P_A^\circ - P_s}{P_A^\circ} $
Let's rearrange the notes formula for $M_B$:
$ M_B = \frac{W_B \times M_A \times P_A^\circ}{W_A \times (P_A^\circ - P_s)} $
This is the same formula as derived earlier.

Let's re-do the calculation with the numbers given:
$W_B = 6 \text{ g}$
$W_A = 90 \text{ g}$
$P_s = 190 \text{ mm Hg}$
$P_A^\circ = 200 \text{ mm Hg}$
$M_A = 18 \text{ g/mol}$

$P_A^\circ - P_s = 200 - 190 = 10 \text{ mm Hg}$

$ M_B = \frac{6 \times 18 \times 200}{90 \times 10} $
$ M_B = \frac{21600}{900} $
$ M_B = 24 \text{ g/mol} $

The notes arrived at 60 g/mol. Let's see if there was a typo in the problem or my derivation.
The notes actually do:
$\frac{6 \times 18}{MB \times 90} = \frac{200 - 196}{200}$
It seems the notes used $P_s = 196 \text{ mmHg}$ and $P_A^\circ = 200 \text{ mmHg}$ for the example, not $P_s=190$. If $P_s=196$, then $(P_A^\circ - P_s) = 4$.

Let's use the values *from the question statement* in the PDF which are $P_s=190$ and $P_A^\circ=200$.
If the question is as stated "V.P of solution is 190 mm Hg" and "Vapour pressure of water at 2°C is 200 mmHg", then:
$P_A^\circ - P_s = 200 - 190 = 10 \text{ mmHg}$.

Let's follow the notes calculation directly from the point it says "Let's plug in values":
$ \frac{6}{MB} \times \frac{18}{90} = \frac{200-196}{200} $ (Here, the notes used 196 instead of 190, which is likely a correction from the problem statement or a different problem).
Let's assume the notes are correct and it *should* be 196.
$ \frac{6}{MB} \times \frac{18}{90} = \frac{4}{200} $
$ \frac{6}{MB} \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{50} $
$ \frac{6}{5 \times MB} = \frac{1}{50} $
$ 50 \times 6 = 5 \times MB $
$ 300 = 5 \times MB $
$ MB = \frac{300}{5} = 60 \text{ g/mol} $

So, the notes *used* $P_s = 196 \text{ mmHg}$ in their calculation, even though the problem statement *said* 190 mmHg. I will explain using the notes' calculation, but point out the discrepancy.

**Let's use the values used in the notes' calculation for consistency:**
*   Weight of urea ($W_B$) = 6 grams
*   Weight of water ($W_A$) = 90 grams
*   Vapour pressure of the solution ($P_s$) = 196 mm Hg (as used in the calculation, not 190 mm Hg from question statement)
*   Vapour pressure of pure water ($P_A^\circ$) = 200 mm Hg
*   Molar mass of water ($M_A$) = 18 grams/mole

**Using the formula from Q.11 (and used in the notes):**
$$ M_B = \frac{W_B \times M_A \times P_A^\circ}{(P_A^\circ - P_s) \times W_A} $$

**Let's plug in the numbers used in the notes:**
$$ M_B = \frac{6 \text{ g} \times 18 \text{ g/mol} \times 200 \text{ mm Hg}}{(200 \text{ mm Hg} - 196 \text{ mm Hg}) \times 90 \text{ g}} $$

First, calculate $(P_A^\circ - P_s)$:
$200 - 196 = 4 \text{ mm Hg}$

Now, let's put that back in:
$$ M_B = \frac{6 \times 18 \times 200}{4 \times 90} $$

Calculate the top part: $6 \times 18 \times 200 = 21600$
Calculate the bottom part: $4 \times 90 = 360$

So,
$$ M_B = \frac{21600}{360} $$
$$ M_B = 60 \text{ g/mol} $$

**Answer:** The molar mass of urea is 60 g/mol. (Note: The calculation in the notes used a vapor pressure of the solution of 196 mmHg, even though the problem stated 190 mmHg. We followed the calculation from the notes to get 60 g/mol).

### ❓ Q.13: Ideal and Non-Ideal Solutions – Like Perfect and Not-So-Perfect Friends

Imagine you're mixing different types of friends at a party.

**1. Ideal Solution (Perfect Friends):**
*   These friends behave *perfectly* according to the rules (like Raoult's Law).
*   When you mix them, they don't get hotter or colder (no heat change, $ \Delta H_{mix} = 0 $).
*   The total space they take up is exactly what you'd expect from adding their individual spaces (no volume change, $ \Delta V_{mix} = 0 $).
*   The attraction between different types of friends is just like the attraction between friends of the same type.
*   **Example:** Mixing n-hexane and n-heptane.

**2. Non-Ideal Solution (Not-So-Perfect Friends):**
*   These friends *don't* behave perfectly according to the rules.
*   When you mix them, it might get hotter or colder ($ \Delta H_{mix} \ne 0 $).
*   The total space they take up might be more or less than you'd expect ($ \Delta V_{mix} \ne 0 $).
*   The attraction between different types of friends is *different* from the attraction between friends of the same type.

Non-ideal solutions can be further divided into two types: those with **positive deviation** and those with **negative deviation**. We'll talk about these next!

### ❓ Q.14: Positive and Negative Deviations (Types of Not-So-Perfect Friends)

Remember, non-ideal solutions don't follow Raoult's Law perfectly. They can "deviate" or stray from it in two ways:

**1. Positive Deviation (Friends who are *too* excited!):**
*   **What happens:** The vapor pressure of the solution is *higher* than what Raoult's Law predicts. It's like the friends are so excited to get away from each other that more of them "escape" as vapor.
*   **Properties:**
    *   **Vapor Pressure:** Higher than expected. ($ P_A > P_A^\circ X_A $ and $ P_B > P_B^\circ X_B $)
    *   **Heat Change ($ \Delta H_{mix} $):** The solution gets cooler (absorbs heat, so $ \Delta H_{mix} = \text{positive} $). This means they need energy to separate from each other.
    *   **Volume Change ($ \Delta V_{mix} $):** The solution takes up more space than expected ($ \Delta V_{mix} = \text{positive} $).
    *   **Boiling Point:** They form "low boiling point azeotropes" (mixtures that boil at a lower temperature than either pure component).
*   **Reason:** The attraction between different types of particles (A-B) is *weaker* than the attraction between particles of the same type (A-A or B-B). So, they prefer to be apart and escape more easily.
*   **Example:** Ethanol and water, Acetone and Carbon disulfide.

**2. Negative Deviation (Friends who *really* like each other!):**
*   **What happens:** The vapor pressure of the solution is *lower* than what Raoult's Law predicts. It's like the friends really stick together, so fewer of them "escape" as vapor.
*   **Properties:**
    *   **Vapor Pressure:** Lower than expected. ($ P_A < P_A^\circ X_A $ and $ P_B < P_B^\circ X_B $)
    *   **Heat Change ($ \Delta H_{mix} $):** The solution gets hotter (releases heat, so $ \Delta H_{mix} = \text{negative} $). This means they give out energy when they get together.
    *   **Volume Change ($ \Delta V_{mix} $):** The solution takes up less space than expected ($ \Delta V_{mix} = \text{negative} $).
    *   **Boiling Point:** They form "high boiling point azeotropes" (mixtures that boil at a higher temperature than either pure component).
*   **Reason:** The attraction between different types of particles (A-B) is *stronger* than the attraction between particles of the same type (A-A or B-B). So, they prefer to stay together and escape less easily.
*   **Example:** Acetone and chloroform, Nitric acid and water.

### ❓ Q.15: What is an "Azeotropic Mixture"?

Imagine you're trying to separate two liquids by boiling them, like alcohol and water. Usually, the one that boils first (alcohol) comes off as vapor, and you can collect it. But for some special mixtures, this doesn't work!

An **azeotropic mixture** (or just **azeotrope**) is a solution that:
*   Boils at a **constant temperature**.
*   Its vapor has the **same composition** (the same mix of components) as the liquid.

This means if you boil an azeotrope, the vapor you get is exactly the same as the liquid you started with. You can't separate the components by simple distillation (boiling and condensing). It's like a perfect blend that won't separate, no matter how much you try to boil it.

**Types of Azeotropic Mixtures:**
There are two main types, linked to the non-ideal solutions:

**1. Low Boiling Azeotropes:**
*   These are formed by solutions that show **positive deviation** from Raoult's Law.
*   They have a **higher vapor pressure** than expected.
*   Their boiling point is **lower** than the boiling point of *either* of the pure components.
*   **Example:** Ethanol (95%) and water (5%). This mixture boils at a lower temperature than pure ethanol or pure water.

**2. High Boiling Azeotropes:**
*   These are formed by solutions that show **negative deviation** from Raoult's Law.
*   They have a **lower vapor pressure** than expected.
*   Their boiling point is **higher** than the boiling point of *either* of the pure components.
*   **Example:** Nitric acid (68%) and water (32%). This mixture boils at a higher temperature than pure nitric acid or pure water.

### ❓ Q.16: Differences between Ideal and Non-Ideal Solutions

Here's a simple table to compare the "perfect" and "not-so-perfect" friends:

| Feature                   | Ideal Solution                                       | Non-Ideal Solution                                |
| :------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **Raoult's Law**          | Obeys Raoult's Law perfectly.                        | Does not obey Raoult's Law.                       |
| **Heat Change ($ \Delta H_{mix} $)** | No heat change when mixed ($ = 0 $).                 | Heat is either absorbed or released ($ \ne 0 $). |
| **Volume Change ($ \Delta V_{mix} $)** | No volume change when mixed ($ = 0 $).               | Volume changes ($ \ne 0 $).                       |
| **Interactions**          | A-B interactions are similar to A-A and B-B.       | A-B interactions are different from A-A and B-B. |
| **Azeotropes**            | Do not form azeotropes.                              | Can form azeotropes (low or high boiling).        |
| **Examples**              | n-hexane & n-heptane, Benzene & Toluene.             | Ethanol & water, Acetone & chloroform.            | |

### ❓ Q.17: Differences between Positive and Negative Deviations

Here's how the "not-so-perfect" friends can be different from each other:

| Feature                   | Positive Deviation                                     | Negative Deviation                                   |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vapor Pressure**        | Higher than expected by Raoult's Law.                  | Lower than expected by Raoult's Law.                 |
| **Heat Change ($ \Delta H_{mix} $)** | Solution gets cooler (absorbs heat, $ +ve $).           | Solution gets hotter (releases heat, $ -ve $).     |
| **Volume Change ($ \Delta V_{mix} $)** | Volume increases ($ +ve $).                             | Volume decreases ($ -ve $).                          |
| **Azeotrope**             | Forms low boiling azeotropes.                          | Forms high boiling azeotropes.                       |
| **Interactions**          | A-B interactions are weaker than A-A and B-B.          | A-B interactions are stronger than A-A and B-B.      | |

### ❓ Q.18: What is "Elevation of Boiling Point"?

Imagine water normally boils at 100°C. If you add some salt to it, something magical happens: the water will now need to get *hotter* than 100°C to boil! This "increase" in the boiling temperature is called **Elevation of Boiling Point**.

*   It's a **colligative property** because it only depends on how many salt particles you add, not what kind of salt they are.

If:
*   $T_b^\circ$ = Boiling point of the pure liquid (solvent, like pure water)
*   $T_s$ = Boiling point of the solution (water with salt)

Then, the **Elevation of Boiling Point** ($ \Delta T_b $) is:
$$ \Delta T_b = T_s - T_b^\circ $$

**Molal Boiling Point Elevation Constant ($K_b$):**
This is a special number for *each* liquid (solvent) that tells you *exactly* how much its boiling point will go up.
*   It's the increase in boiling point ($ \Delta T_b $) when you dissolve 1 "piece" (mole) of a solute in 1 kg of that liquid.
*   Its unit is Kelvin kg/mol ($ \text{K kg mol}^{-1} $).
*   It only depends on the *solvent*, not on the solute you add.

The formula connecting these is:
$$ \Delta T_b = K_b \times m $$
Where $m$ is the molality of the solution (moles of solute per kg of solvent).

### ❓ Q.19: Finding the "weight of one piece" (Molar Mass) using Elevation of Boiling Point

Just like with vapor pressure, we can use the elevation of boiling point to find the molar mass of an unknown substance.

**Here's the idea:**
1.  We know the formula for elevation of boiling point: $ \Delta T_b = K_b \times m $
2.  We also know the formula for molality ($m$):
    $$ m = \frac{\text{Moles of Solute}}{\text{Mass of Solvent (in kg)}} = \frac{W_B/M_B}{W_A/1000} $$
    Where:
    *   $W_B$ = Weight of solute (in grams)
    *   $M_B$ = Molar mass of solute (in grams/mole)
    *   $W_A$ = Weight of solvent (in grams)

3.  Now, substitute the molality ($m$) into the $ \Delta T_b $ equation:
    $$ \Delta T_b = K_b \times \frac{W_B \times 1000}{M_B \times W_A} $$

4.  To find the molar mass of the solute ($M_B$), we can rearrange this equation:
    $$ M_B = \frac{K_b \times W_B \times 1000}{\Delta T_b \times W_A} $$

This formula helps you calculate the molar mass ($M_B$) of the non-volatile solute if you know all the other values (Kb, weights, and the change in boiling temperature).

### ❓ Q.20: Let's calculate the Molar Mass of Urea again!

This is a practice problem for finding molar mass using elevation of boiling point.

**Here's what we know:**
*   Weight of urea ($W_B$) = 12.5 grams
*   Weight of water ($W_A$) = 170 grams
*   Boiling point of the solution ($T_s$) = 100.63 °C
*   Boiling point of pure water ($T_b^\circ$) = 100 °C (this is a known standard for water)
*   Molal boiling point elevation constant ($K_b$) for water = 0.52 K kg/mol

**We want to find:** Molar mass of urea ($M_B$).

**Step 1: Calculate the Elevation of Boiling Point ($ \Delta T_b $):**
$$ \Delta T_b = T_s - T_b^\circ = 100.63^\circ\text{C} - 100^\circ\text{C} = 0.63^\circ\text{C} $$
(Note: A change of 0.63°C is the same as 0.63 K, so $ \Delta T_b = 0.63 \text{ K} $).

**Step 2: Use the formula from Q.19:**
$$ M_B = \frac{K_b \times W_B \times 1000}{\Delta T_b \times W_A} $$

**Let's plug in the numbers:**
$$ M_B = \frac{0.52 \text{ K kg/mol} \times 12.5 \text{ g} \times 1000}{0.63 \text{ K} \times 170 \text{ g}} $$

Calculate the top part: $0.52 \times 12.5 \times 1000 = 6500$
Calculate the bottom part: $0.63 \times 170 = 107.1$

So,
$$ M_B = \frac{6500}{107.1} $$
$$ M_B \approx 60.74 \text{ g/mol} $$

**Answer:** The molar mass of urea is approximately 60.74 g/mol. (This is very close to the known molar mass of urea, which is 60.06 g/mol, so the calculation is correct).

### ❓ Q.21: What is "Depression of Freezing Point"?

Imagine water normally freezes at 0°C. If you add some salt to it, the water will now need to get *colder* than 0°C to freeze! This "decrease" in the freezing temperature is called **Depression of Freezing Point**. That's why people put salt on icy roads in winter – it makes the ice melt because the freezing point goes down.

*   It's a **colligative property** because it only depends on how many salt particles you add, not what kind of salt they are.

If:
*   $T_f^\circ$ = Freezing point of the pure liquid (solvent, like pure water)
*   $T_s$ = Freezing point of the solution (water with salt)

Then, the **Depression of Freezing Point** ($ \Delta T_f $) is:
$$ \Delta T_f = T_f^\circ - T_s $$

**Molal Freezing Point Depression Constant ($K_f$):**
This is a special number for *each* liquid (solvent) that tells you *exactly* how much its freezing point will go down.
*   It's the decrease in freezing point ($ \Delta T_f $) when you dissolve 1 "piece" (mole) of a solute in 1 kg of that liquid.
*   Its unit is Kelvin kg/mol ($ \text{K kg mol}^{-1} $).
*   It only depends on the *solvent*, not on the solute you add.

The formula connecting these is:
$$ \Delta T_f = K_f \times m $$
Where $m$ is the molality of the solution.

### ❓ Q.22: Let's calculate the Freezing Point of a Glucose Solution!

This is a practice problem for finding the freezing point of a solution.

**Here's what we know:**
*   We have a "1% glucose solution in water". This means:
    *   Weight of glucose ($W_B$) = 1 gram
    *   Weight of water ($W_A$) = 99 grams (because $100 - 1 = 99$)
*   Molar mass of glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) = 180 grams/mole (from the notes, although it's good to know how to calculate it: $6 \times 12 + 12 \times 1 + 6 \times 16 = 72 + 12 + 96 = 180$).
*   Molal freezing point depression constant ($K_f$) for water = 1.8 K kg/mol
*   Freezing point of pure water ($T_f^\circ$) = 0 °C = 273 K

**We want to find:** The freezing point of the solution ($T_s$).

**Step 1: Calculate the molality ($m$) of the solution.**
$$ m = \frac{W_B \times 1000}{M_B \times W_A} $$
$$ m = \frac{1 \text{ g} \times 1000}{180 \text{ g/mol} \times 99 \text{ g}} $$

Calculate the top: $1 \times 1000 = 1000$
Calculate the bottom: $180 \times 99 = 17820$

$$ m = \frac{1000}{17820} \approx 0.0561 \text{ mol/kg} $$

**Step 2: Calculate the Depression of Freezing Point ($ \Delta T_f $).**
$$ \Delta T_f = K_f \times m $$
$$ \Delta T_f = 1.8 \text{ K kg/mol} \times 0.0561 \text{ mol/kg} $$
$$ \Delta T_f \approx 0.101 \text{ K} $$

**Step 3: Calculate the Freezing Point of the Solution ($T_s$).**
$$ T_s = T_f^\circ - \Delta T_f $$
$$ T_s = 273 \text{ K} - 0.101 \text{ K} $$
$$ T_s \approx 272.899 \text{ K} $$

If we want it in Celsius: $272.899 - 273.15 = -0.251^\circ\text{C}$.
The notes show $273 - 0.1 = 272.9 \text{ K}$, which is close due to rounding.

**Answer:** The freezing point of the 1% glucose solution is approximately 272.9 K (or -0.25°C).

### ❓ Q.24: What is an Antifreeze Agent?

An **antifreeze agent** is a substance that you add to a liquid (usually water) to **lower its freezing point**. This is super helpful because it stops the liquid from turning into ice when it gets very cold.

**Why is Ethylene Glycol a good Antifreeze?**
*   Ethylene glycol is commonly used in car radiators.
*   Cars need a cooling liquid (usually water) to keep the engine from overheating.
*   In cold places, this water could freeze and damage the engine parts.
*   When ethylene glycol is mixed with water, it causes a significant **depression of the freezing point** (as we learned in Q.21).
*   This means the mixture will freeze at a much lower temperature than pure water, protecting the car's radiator even in very cold weather.
*   So, ethylene glycol is called an anti-freezing compound because it prevents water from freezing in radiators by lowering its freezing point.

### ❓ Q.25: Explaining Semi-Permeable Membranes, Osmosis, and Osmotic Pressure

**i) Semi-Permeable Membrane (SPM):**
Imagine a special fence or a filter that has tiny holes.
*   This fence only lets **small particles** (like water molecules) pass through.
*   It **blocks bigger particles** (like sugar or salt molecules).
*   Think of it like a coffee filter that lets water through but keeps the coffee grounds out.
*   **Examples:** Parchment paper, animal bladders, or special synthetic membranes.

**ii) Osmosis:**
Now, imagine you have two glasses separated by this special fence (SPM).
*   One glass has pure water (lots of small water particles).
*   The other glass has sugar water (fewer water particles because some space is taken by sugar).
*   **Osmosis** is the natural movement of only the **water particles** through the SPM. They will move from the side where there's *more water* (pure water) to the side where there's *less water* (sugar water).
*   It's like water trying to dilute the sugary side to make the concentration equal on both sides.

**iii) Osmotic Pressure ($ \Pi $):**
If you put sugar water on one side and pure water on the other side of an SPM, water will start flowing into the sugar water side (osmosis). This flow will cause the liquid level on the sugar water side to rise, creating a "push" or pressure.
**Osmotic pressure** is the exact amount of "push" or pressure you would need to apply to the sugar water side to **stop** the water from flowing in (to stop osmosis).
*   It's the pressure required to prevent the net flow of solvent across a semipermeable membrane into a solution.
*   It is also a **colligative property**, meaning it only depends on the number of dissolved particles, not their type.

### ❓ Q.26: Differences between Osmosis and Diffusion

These two words sound similar, but they describe different types of movement:

| Feature         | Osmosis                                                                             | Diffusion                                                            |     |
| :-------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| **What moves?** | **Only solvent** (like water) particles.                                            | **Both solute and solvent** particles.                               |     |
| **Membrane?**   | **Requires a semi-permeable membrane**.                                             | **Does not require a membrane** (can happen freely).                 |     |
| **Direction**   | Solvent moves from **high solvent concentration** to **low solvent concentration**. | Particles move from **high concentration** to **low concentration**. |     |
| **Goal**        | To equalize solvent concentration across a membrane.                                | To equalize overall concentration throughout the space.              |     |
| **Example**     | Water moving into a raisin placed in plain water.                                   | The smell of perfume spreading in a room.                            |     |
