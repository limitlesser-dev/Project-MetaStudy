Given:

Mass of water ($WC$) = $40 \text{ gm}$

Molar mass:
Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) ($MA$) = $60$
Ethanol (C₂H₅OH) ($MB$) = $46$
Water (H₂O) ($MC$) = $18$

Moles of each component:
$n_A = \frac{WA}{MA} = \frac{30}{60} = 0.5 \text{ mol}$ (acetic acid)
$n_B = \frac{WB}{MB} = \frac{30}{46} = 0.65 \text{ mol}$ (ethanol)

#Q
Prove that the molarity and molality of pure water is always one or equal.
?
For pure water:
Density = $1 \text{ gm/ml}$
Molar mass (H₂O) = $18 \text{ gm/mol}$

Consider $1000 \text{ ml}$ of water.
Mass = $1000 \text{ ml} \times 1 \text{ gm/ml} = 1000 \text{ gm}$.
Moles = $1000 \text{ gm} / 18 \text{ gm/mol} = 55.56 \text{ mol}$.

Molarity (M):
Solute = water, Solvent = water (conceptually, consider water as the "solute" in its own volume).
$M = \frac{\text{Moles of Solute}}{\text{Volume of Solution (L)}} = \frac{55.56 \text{ mol}}{1 \text{ L}} = 55.56 \text{ M}$
(Using formula from notes: $M = \frac{WB \times 1000}{MB \times V} = \frac{1000 \times 1000}{18 \times 1000} = 55.56$)

Molality (m):
Solute = water, Solvent = water.
$m = \frac{\text{Moles of Solute}}{\text{Mass of Solvent (kg)}} = \frac{55.56 \text{ mol}}{1 \text{ kg}} = 55.56 \text{ m}$
(Using formula from notes: $m = \frac{WB \times 1000}{MB \times WA} = \frac{1000 \times 1000}{18 \times 1000} = 55.56$)

Thus, for pure H₂O, Molarity and Molality are both ==55.56==, proving they are equal.

#Q
What is a ==Colligative property==?:: The property of Solution which depends only on the ==number of Solute and Solvent particles==, but not on the nature of both Components.

#Q

?

#Q
Define ==Vapour pressure (P)==.:: The pressure created by the vapour over the surface of the liquid at equilibrium state and constant temperature.

#Q
Define ==Lowering of vapour pressure==.:: When a non-volatile Solute is added to a Volatile Solvent, the Vapour pressure of solution is decreased/lowered.

#Q
If Vapour pressure of pure Solvent is $P_A^\circ$ and Vapour pressure of Solution containing non-volatile Solute is $P_S$, then lowering in Vapour pressure is ==$P_A^\circ - P_S$==.

#Q
Why does adding a non-volatile solute lower vapour pressure?
?
Solvent molecules escape from the surface of the liquid. When non-volatile solute is added, solute molecules occupy a certain area of the surface. Therefore, the number of solvent molecules on the surface decreases, and less solvent molecules escape into vapours. This leads to the Vapour pressure of Solution being ==less than== Vapour pressure of pure Solvent.
?

#Q
Define ==Relative lowering of vapour pressure==.
?
The ratio of lowering of V.P. ($P_A^\circ - P_S$) and Vapour pressure of pure solvent ($P_A^\circ$). This ratio does not depend upon the temperature.
Formula: $$ \text{Relative Lowering of V.P.} = \frac{P_A^\circ - P_S}{P_A^\circ} $$
?

#Q
What is ==Raoult's Law==?
?
According to Raoult's Law, the relative lowering of vapour pressure of a solution containing non-volatile solute is equal to the ==mole fraction of the non-volatile Solute==.
Mathematical expression for non-volatile solute:
$P_S \propto X_A$ (where $P_S$ is VP of solution, $X_A$ is mole fraction of solvent)
$P_S = K X_A$
For pure solvent, $X_A = 1$ and $P_S = P_A^\circ$, so $K = P_A^\circ$.
Thus, $P_S = P_A^\circ \cdot X_A$.
Since $X_A = (1 - X_B)$, then $P_S = P_A^\circ (1 - X_B)$.
Rearranging: $P_S = P_A^\circ - P_A^\circ X_B \implies P_A^\circ X_B = P_A^\circ - P_S$.
So, $$ X_B = \frac{P_A^\circ - P_S}{P_A^\circ} $$
This proves that relative lowering of vapour pressure is a ==colligative property==.
?

#Q
What is Raoult's law if ==both components are Volatile==?:: The vapour pressure of a solution containing volatile solute is directly proportional to the ==mole fraction of solvent==.

#Q
What are the relations for partial pressures if both components are volatile (A and B)?
?
$P_A \propto X_A$ and $P_B \propto X_B$
$P_A = P_A^\circ \cdot X_A$ and $P_B = P_B^\circ \cdot X_B$
?

#Q
Calculate the molar mass of non-volatile solute with the help of Raoult's law.
?
From Raoult's Law: $$ X_B = \frac{P_A^\circ - P_S}{P_A^\circ} \quad \text{(Equation 1)} $$
Also, $X_B = \frac{n_B}{n_A + n_B}$. If $n_A \gg n_B$ (very dilute solution), then $X_B \approx \frac{n_B}{n_A}$.
Substitute $n_B = \frac{WB}{MB}$ and $n_A = \frac{WA}{MA}$:
$$ X_B = \frac{WB/MB}{WA/MA} = \frac{WB \times MA}{MB \times WA} $$
Substitute this into Equation 1:
$$ \frac{WB \times MA}{MB \times WA} = \frac{P_A^\circ - P_S}{P_A^\circ} $$
Rearranging to find $MB$ (molar mass of non-volatile solute):
$$ MB = \frac{WB \times MA}{WA} \times \frac{P_A^\circ}{P_A^\circ - P_S} $$
?

#Q
The V.P. of Solution Containing 6 gm of urea in 90gm water at 20°C and V.P. of solution is 190 mm Hg. Calculate the molar mass of Urea. (Vapour pressure of water at 20°C is 200 mmHg)
?
Given:
Mass of urea ($WB$) = $6 \text{ gm}$
Mass of water ($WA$) = $90 \text{ gm}$
Molar mass of water ($MA$) = $18$
V.P. of solution ($P_S$) = $196 \text{ mmHg}$ (Note: PDF has 190 in Q, 196 in calculation. Using 196 from calculation.)
V.P. of pure water ($P_A^\circ$) = $200 \text{ mmHg}$
Molar mass of urea ($MB$) = ?

Formula: $$ \frac{WB \times MA}{MB \times WA} = \frac{P_A^\circ - P_S}{P_A^\circ} $$
$$ \frac{6 \times 18}{MB \times 90} = \frac{200 - 196}{200} $$
$$ \frac{108}{90 \times MB} = \frac{4}{200} $$
$$ \frac{108}{90 \times MB} = \frac{1}{50} $$
$$ 90 \times MB = 108 \times 50 $$
$$ MB = \frac{108 \times 50}{90} = \frac{5400}{90} = 60 \text{ Ans.} $$

#Q

Mass of solvent (water) ($WA$) = $170 \text{ gm}$
Boiling point of Solution ($T_S$) = $100.63^\circ \text{C}$
Molal elevation Constant ($K_b$) = $0.52 \text{ K kg mol}^{-1}$
Boiling point of pure water ($T_b^\circ$) = $100^\circ \text{C}$
Molar mass of urea ($MB$) = ?

Calculate $\Delta T_b$:
$\Delta T_b = T_S - T_b^\circ = 100.63^\circ \text{C} - 100^\circ \text{C} = 0.63^\circ \text{C}$ or $0.63 \text{ K}$

Formula for $MB$: $$ MB = \frac{K_b \times WB \times 1000}{\Delta T_b \times WA} $$
$$ MB = \frac{0.52 \times 12.5 \times 1000}{0.63 \times 170} $$
$$ MB = \frac{6500}{107.1} = 60.74 \text{ Ans.} $$

#Q
Relationship between Depression in freezing point and molality.:: The depression of freezing point is ==directly proportional to molal Concentration of Solute== ($ \Delta T_f \propto m $).

#Q
Formula for Depression in freezing point using molality.:: $$ \Delta T_f = K_f \cdot m $$

#Q
Calculate the molar mass of non-volatile Solute with the help of depression of freezing point.
?
From $\Delta T_f = K_f \cdot m$
Substitute $m = \frac{WB \times 1000}{MB \times WA}$:
$$ \Delta T_f = K_f \times \frac{WB \times 1000}{MB \times WA} $$
Rearranging to find $MB$:
$$ MB = \frac{K_f \times WB \times 1000}{\Delta T_f \times WA} $$

#Q
Calculate the freezing point of 1% glucose solution in water ($K_f$ = 1.8 K kg mol⁻¹).
?
Given:
Mass of Glucose ($WB$) = $1 \text{ gm}$ (since 1% means 1 gm in 100 gm solution; implies 1 gm solute in 99 gm solvent for dilute solutions)
Mass of water ($WA$) = $99 \text{ gm}$
Molar mass of Glucose ($MB$) = $180 \text{ gm/mol}$ (from previous flashcard example)
Molal depression Constant ($K_f$) = $1.8 \text{ K kg mol}^{-1}$
Freezing point of pure water ($T_f^\circ$) = $0^\circ \text{C}$ or $273 \text{ K}$

Calculate $\Delta T_f$:
Formula: $$ \Delta T_f = K_f \times \frac{WB \times 1000}{MB \times WA} $$
$$ \Delta T_f = 1.8 \times \frac{1 \times 1000}{180 \times 99} $$
$$ \Delta T_f = \frac{1800}{17820} = 0.101 \approx 0.11 \text{ K} $$

Calculate freezing point of solution ($T_f$):
$\Delta T_f = T_f^\circ - T_f$
$0.11 = 273 - T_f$
$T_f = 273 - 0.11 = 272.89 \text{ K} \approx 272.9 \text{ K} \text{ Ans.}$

#Q
What is an ==antifreezing agent==?:: Substance or Compound which ==depress the freezing point== of liquid.

#Q
Why is ==ethylene glycol== known as an anti-freezing compound?
?
Water is used in radiators of cars as a cooling agent. If the temperature is below $0^\circ \text{C}$, water would freeze in the radiators. When ethylene glycol is mixed in water, the freezing point of this solution (water + glycol) gets lowered, allowing radiators to work properly. This is why ethylene glycol is called an antifreezing agent.

#Q
Define ==Osmosis==.
?
When two solutions of different Concentration are separated by Semi-permeable membrane, the flow of ==solvent molecules== takes place from a solution of ==lower Concentration== to ==higher Concentration solution==. This process is called osmosis.
?

#Q
Define ==Osmotic pressure (π)==.
?
1. Osmotic pressure is equal to the ==hydrostatic pressure== which develops when a Solution is separated from a Solvent through a Semi-permeable membrane.
2. The hydrostatic pressure of the column of the Solution that is just ==sufficient to prevent the entry of more Solvent== into the solution from the solvent, separated by a Semi-permeable membrane.
Osmotic pressure is represented by ==π==.
