# 📚 MetaStudy: Rethinking Learning with AI, Mental Models & Smart Systems

Welcome to the MetaStudy project — a personal and experimental journey to challenge traditional study methods using:
- 🤖 Artificial Intelligence (as a thinking/learning partner)
- 🧠 Mental Models & Cognitive Frameworks
- 🛠️ Smart Study Tricks & Learning Hacks

This is **not** just a knowledge base — it's a **real-time, reflective experiment** to test whether this new system is actually better.

---

## 🧭 Project Goals

- Challenge the default "school-style" learning model.
- Explore how AI can personalize and supercharge learning.
- Build and test a toolbox of mental models and frameworks.
- Measure and reflect on progress over time (daily/weekly logs).
- Document everything openly — successes, failures, and pivots.

## 📅 Learning Log

I'll be regularly logging progress:
- What I tried
- What worked/didn't
- What I learned
- How the system is evolving

👉 [See Logs](./logs/) for updates

## 📐 Core Philosophy

> “Learning isn’t about stuffing your brain — it’s about building a system that thinks better.”

Traditional study often focuses on memorization. This project explores:
- Thinking **from first principles**
- Using **frameworks to guide action**
- Leveraging **AI to simulate mentors, tutors, or sparring partners**

## ⚙️ Tech & Tools

- ChatGPT (AI assistance)
- Custom prompts & tools (in `/ai-tools/`)
- Markdown for documentation
- GitHub for version control & reflection history

---

## ✨ Status: Ongoing Experiment

I don’t know if this method will work better — that’s the point.

But by documenting every step, we’ll find out.
