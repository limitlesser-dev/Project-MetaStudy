## 📚 MetaStudy: Rethinking Learning with AI, Mental Models & Smart Systems

Welcome to MetaStudy — an ongoing, personal experiment challenging traditional study methods using:
- 🤖 Artificial Intelligence as a thinking/learning partner
- 🧠 Mental Models & Cognitive Frameworks
- 🛠️ Smart Study Tricks & Learning Hacks

_Not just a knowledge base — a real-time, reflective experiment in building a better system for learning._

---

## 🧭 Project Goals

- Challenge the default “school-style” learning model
- Explore how AI can personalize and supercharge learning
- Build and test a toolbox of mental models and frameworks
- Measure and reflect on progress over time (via logs)
- Document everything openly — successes, failures, and pivots

**These goals remain active and unchanged.**

---

## 📝 Progress & Lessons

This project is under active development. Key lessons, experiments, and reflections are captured in logs and commit messages.

- See `/logs/` for regular progress updates and insights
- Review commit history for snapshots of daily learning and pivots

## 📐 Core Philosophy

> “Learning isn’t about stuffing your brain — it’s about building a system that thinks better.”

This project focuses on:
- Thinking from first principles
- Using frameworks to guide action
- Leveraging AI to simulate mentors, tutors, or sparring partners

---

## ⚙️ Tech & Tools

- AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini)
- Markdown documentation
- GitHub for version control & reflection history

---

## ✨ Status: Actively Experimenting

The system is a work in progress — goals, methods, and results continue to evolve as I learn.
