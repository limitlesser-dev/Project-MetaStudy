Here are detailed notes on "Electric Charges and Fields" based on the provided sources:

## I. Introduction to Electric Charges and Fields

The study of electric charges and fields in Class 12 Physics is broadly divided into two main parts:

- **Electrostatics**: This branch deals with the study of **charges at rest**. Chapters one and two typically fall under electrostatics.
- **Electrodynamics**: This branch deals with the study of **charges in motion**. Chapters from the third onwards are generally considered part of electrodynamics, which also indirectly covers magnetism.

### A. Electric Charge

Electric charge is a **fundamental property of matter**. It is an inherent property that allows a body to:

- Produce an electric field around itself.
- Experience an electric force when placed in an electromagnetic field.

**1. Types of Charges**:

- **Positive Charge**: A body acquires a positive charge when it has **fewer electrons than protons**. This typically happens when a body _loses electrons_. For example, sodium, calcium, and aluminum give up electrons to become positively charged.
- **Negative Charge**: A body acquires a negative charge when it has **more electrons than protons**. This typically happens when a body _gains electrons_. For instance, non-metals like chlorine, sulfur, and oxygen gain electrons to become negatively charged.

**2. Neutral Body**:

- A neutral body contains **equal amounts of positive and negative charges**. For example, atoms normally have an equal number of electrons and protons, making them neutral.
- It is **incorrect to say that a neutral body has no charge**; it merely has an equal balance of charges.

**3. SI Unit and Basic Charge Value**:

- The SI unit of electric charge is **Coulomb (C)**.
- The charge on a single electron is **-1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C**.
- The charge on a single proton is **+1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C**. Both have the same magnitude of charge.

### B. Properties of Electric Charge

Electric charges exhibit three basic properties:

1. **Additivity of Charge**: Total charge in a system is the algebraic sum of all individual charges, considering their sign. For example, if a system has -3 C, +2 C, +10 C, and -5 C, the total charge is (-3 + 2 + 10 - 5) = 4 C. Charge is a **scalar quantity**.
2. **Conservation of Charge**: Electric charge can neither be created nor destroyed, but it can be transferred from one body to another. The total charge of an isolated system remains constant.
3. **Quantization of Charge**: Electric charge always exists as an integral multiple of the basic quantum of charge, which is the charge of an electron (e).
    - The minimum possible charge a body can have is one electron's charge.
    - Any charge (Q) on a body can be expressed as **Q = ±ne**, where 'n' is an integer (1, 2, 3, ...) representing the number of electrons transferred.
    - Charge cannot take any random continuous value (e.g., 1.5e).
4. **Invariance of Charge**: The value of charge on a particle remains the same regardless of its speed (whether at rest or moving at very high speeds). This is in contrast to mass, length, or time, which can vary with speed.
5. **Association with Mass**: Charge is always associated with mass; there is no charge without mass.

## II. Methods of Charging a Body

There are three main methods to charge a body:

1. **Charging by Friction (Rubbing)**:
    
    - When two bodies are rubbed against each other, electrons are transferred from one body to the other.
    - The body that _gains electrons_ becomes negatively charged, and the body that _loses electrons_ becomes positively charged.
    - This method is primarily effective for **insulators**, which do not have free charges.
    - **Mass variation**: When a body gains or loses electrons, its mass changes due to the mass of electrons transferred. If 'n' electrons are transferred, the mass of the gaining body increases by (n × mass of electron), and the mass of the losing body decreases by (n × mass of electron).
    - **Example**: Rubbing a scale on hair to attract small pieces of paper demonstrates charging by friction.
2. **Charging by Conduction (Contact)**:
    
    - This method involves **direct physical contact** between a charged body and an uncharged body.
    - It typically applies to **identical metallic spheres**.
    - When two identical metallic spheres with charges q1 and q2 are brought into contact, the total charge (q1 + q2) redistributes equally between them when the contact is broken. Each sphere will then have a charge of (q1 + q2)/2.
3. **Charging by Induction**:
    
    - This method involves charging a body **without direct contact** with a charged body.
    - It is primarily applicable to **conductors**, as they have free electrons that can redistribute.
    - **Process**: When a charged body (e.g., a positively charged rod) is brought near an uncharged conductor, the free electrons in the conductor are attracted towards the charged body, creating an accumulation of opposite charge on the near side and similar charge on the far side.
    - **Redistribution of charge**: This process is called redistribution of charge within the body. The overall charge on the conductor remains zero until it is grounded.
    - **Earthing/Grounding**: To permanently charge the body by induction, the conductor is typically grounded (connected to the Earth) while the charged body is still nearby. Earth acts as a vast reservoir of electrons, either supplying or absorbing electrons to neutralize the far side's charge.
    - **Result**: After removing the ground connection and then the charged body, the conductor will be left with a charge opposite to that of the inducing charged body.
    - **Attraction, not repulsion**: An important aspect of induction is that a charged body can **attract an uncharged body, but cannot repel it**. This is because induction causes a redistribution of charges, leading to an attractive force between the inducing charge and the induced opposite charge.

### C. Gold Leaf Electroscope

The gold leaf electroscope is a device used to **detect the presence of charge** on a body.

- It works on the principle of **electrostatic induction**.
- **Construction**: It typically consists of a metal rod with a metal disc or knob at the top and two thin gold leaves (or aluminum foil in a cheaper version) at the bottom, enclosed in a transparent container. Gold is chosen because it is highly malleable and can form very thin, light leaves.
- **Working**: When a charged body is brought near the metal knob, charges redistribute in the electroscope due to induction. For example, if a positive body is brought near, negative charges are attracted to the knob, and positive charges are repelled to the gold leaves. Since both leaves acquire the same type of charge, they repel each other and diverge. This divergence indicates the presence of charge on the test body.
- **Limitation**: The gold leaf electroscope **can detect if a body is charged, but it cannot determine whether the charge is positive or negative**. Regardless of the sign of the inducing charge (positive or negative), the leaves will always diverge if a charge is present.

## III. Coulomb's Law of Electrostatics

Coulomb's Law quantifies the **electrostatic force between two point charges**.

- **Statement**: The magnitude of the electrostatic force between two point charges is **directly proportional to the product of their magnitudes** and **inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers**.
- **Formula**: The magnitude of the force (F) is given by: **F = k * (q1 * q2) / r²** Where:
    - q1 and q2 are the magnitudes of the two point charges.
    - r is the distance between their centers.
    - k is the **electrostatic force constant**.

### A. Electrostatic Force Constant (k)

- The constant 'k' is also known as the **Coulomb constant**.
- Its value **depends on the medium** between the charges.
- For **free space (vacuum or air)**, the value of k is approximately **9 × 10⁹ Nm²C⁻²**.
- **Relationship with Permittivity**: The constant 'k' is related to the permittivity of the medium by the formula: **k = 1 / (4πε)**.

### B. Permittivity (ε)

- **Permittivity of Free Space (ε₀)**: This is the permittivity of vacuum. Its value is **8.85 × 10⁻¹² C²N⁻¹m⁻²**.
- **Permittivity of a Medium (ε)**: Every medium has its own permittivity. It represents how much a medium permits electric field lines to pass through it. A higher permittivity means the medium's charges can disrupt the force between the two interacting charges more, effectively reducing the force.
- **Dielectric Constant (κ or εr)**: Also known as **relative permittivity**. It is defined as the ratio of the permittivity of the medium (ε) to the permittivity of free space (ε₀): **κ = ε / ε₀**.
    - This constant is **dimensionless**.
    - The force in a medium (F_medium) is related to the force in vacuum (F₀) by: **F_medium = F₀ / κ**. This means the force between charges is reduced by a factor of κ in a given medium. For example, for water, κ ≈ 80, meaning the force in water is about 1/80th of the force in vacuum.

### C. Properties of Coulomb's Force

- **Point Charges**: Coulomb's law is valid for **point charges**. It cannot be directly applied to distributed charges (like rods, rings, or disks) without using integration.
- **Conservative Nature**: Electrostatic force is a **conservative force**. This means the work done by this force is independent of the path taken.
- **Medium Dependent**: As discussed, the force varies with the medium between the charges.
- **Action-Reaction Pairs**: Electrostatic forces always exist in **action-reaction pairs**, obeying Newton's third law. The force exerted by q1 on q2 is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force exerted by q2 on q1.
- **Central Force**: The force always acts along the **line joining the centers** of the two charges.

### D. Vector Form of Coulomb's Law

Since force is a vector quantity, Coulomb's Law can also be expressed in vector form.

- If q1 and q2 are at position vectors **r1** and **r2**, the force on q1 due to q2 (F12) can be written as: **F12 = k * (q1 * q2) / |r2 - r1|³ * (r1 - r2)**
- Similarly, the force on q2 due to q1 (F21) is: **F21 = k * (q1 * q2) / |r2 - r1|³ * (r2 - r1)**
- It's important to note that **F12 = -F21**, confirming the action-reaction nature.

### E. Problems Based on Coulomb's Law

- **Symmetrical Structures (e.g., equilateral triangles, squares, hexagons)**: For charges placed at the vertices of symmetrical structures, the net force on a charge at the center (or other symmetrical points) can often be found by vector addition or by recognizing cancellation due to symmetry. For example, if equal charges are placed at the corners of a square, the net force on a charge at the center is zero.
- **Pendulum Problems**: These involve charges suspended by strings, interacting both gravitationally and electrostatically. Free body diagrams and equilibrium conditions (sum of forces = 0) are used to solve them. The ratio of electrostatic force to gravitational force often leads to tanθ = Fe / mg.

## IV. Electric Field

### A. Definition of Electric Field

- **Theoretical Definition**: Electric field is the **region or space around a charge where its influence (electrostatic force) can be felt by other charges**. This region extends to infinity.
- **Mathematical Definition**: Electric field intensity (**E**) at a point is defined as the **electrostatic force (F) experienced per unit positive test charge (q₀)** placed at that point. **E = F / q₀**
    - **SI Unit**: **Newton per Coulomb (N/C)**. It can also be expressed as Volt per meter (V/m).
    - **Vector Quantity**: Electric field is a **vector quantity**.
    - **Direction**: By convention, the direction of the electric field is from **positive charge to negative charge**. For an isolated positive charge, the field lines point radially outward, and for an isolated negative charge, they point radially inward.

### B. Test Charge (q₀)

- **Small Value**: A test charge must be **infinitesimally small (tends to zero)**. This is crucial because a large test charge would produce its own electric field, disrupting the field being measured and making accurate calculation difficult.
- **Positive Convention**: By convention, the test charge is always considered **positive**. This ensures a consistent definition for the direction of the electric field (away from positive charges, towards negative charges).

### C. Electric Field Due to a Point Charge

Using Coulomb's Law (F = k * q * q₀ / r²) and the definition of electric field (E = F / q₀), the electric field (E) due to a point charge (q) at a distance (r) from it is: **E = k * q / r²** Or **E = 1 / (4πε₀) * q / r²** (for free space).

### D. Motion of a Charged Particle in a Uniform Electric Field

- When a charge (q) is placed in an external uniform electric field (E), it experiences an **electric force (F)** given by: **F = qE**.
- **Direction of Force**:
    - If **q is positive**, the force (F) is in the **same direction as the electric field (E)**.
    - If **q is negative**, the force (F) is in the **opposite direction to the electric field (E)**.
- **Acceleration**: If the particle has mass (m), its acceleration (a) is **a = F / m = qE / m**.
- **Kinematics**: If the electric field (and thus acceleration) is constant, standard kinematic equations (e.g., v = u + at, s = ut + ½at²) can be used to describe the motion.

### E. Electric Field Lines (E-Field Lines)

Electric field lines are **imaginary lines** used to visualize the electric field.

- **Definition**: They are lines of force such that the **tangent drawn at any point on the line gives the direction of the electric field intensity** at that point. A small positive test charge released on an electric field line would move along that line.

**1. Properties of Electric Field Lines**:

- **Continuous Smooth Curves**: They are continuous and smooth curves without any breaks or sudden turns. A sudden turn would imply two directions of electric field at one point, which is impossible.
- **Origin and Termination**: They **originate from positive charges** and **terminate on negative charges**.
- **No Closed Loops**: They **never form closed loops**. (Unlike magnetic field lines, which form closed loops).
- **No Intersection**: **Two electric field lines can never intersect each other**. If they did, it would mean that at the point of intersection, there would be two directions for the electric field, which is impossible for a single vector quantity.
- **Perpendicular to Conductor Surface**: Electric field lines are **always perpendicular (normal) to the surface of a conductor**.
- **Density and Strength**: The **closer the field lines are, the stronger the electric field**. The farther apart they are, the weaker the field.
- **Zero Inside Conductor**: Electric field lines **cannot pass through a hollow conductor**. The electric field inside an isolated conductor is always **zero**. This phenomenon is called **electrostatic shielding**.

**2. Patterns of Electric Field Lines**:

- **Isolated Positive Charge**: Lines originate from the charge and extend radially outward to infinity.
- **Isolated Negative Charge**: Lines originate from infinity and extend radially inward towards the charge.
- **Electric Dipole (+q and -q)**: Lines start from the positive charge and end on the negative charge, forming curved paths.
- **Two Like Charges (+q and +q)**: Lines repel each other and bend away, creating a neutral point (where E-field is zero) between them.
- **Infinite Plane Sheet**: Electric field lines are **uniform and parallel**, indicating a constant electric field. They are perpendicular to the surface of the sheet.

## V. Electric Dipole

### A. Definition of Electric Dipole

An electric dipole is a **system of two equal and opposite point charges (+q and -q) separated by a small distance (typically denoted as 2a or 2l)**. The distance is considered "small" compared to the distance of points where its impact is observed.

### B. Electric Dipole Moment (P)

- **Definition**: Electric dipole moment is defined as the **product of the magnitude of either charge (q) and the separation distance (2a)** between them. **P = q × 2a**
- **Vector Quantity**: Dipole moment is a **vector quantity**.
- **Direction**: Its direction is conventionally from the **negative charge to the positive charge**.
- **SI Unit**: **Coulomb-meter (C·m)**. (A small dash between C and m is often used to avoid confusion with centimeter).
- **Total Charge of a Dipole**: The total charge of an electric dipole system is always **zero**.

### C. Electric Field Due to an Electric Dipole

The electric field generated by a dipole depends on the location of the point relative to the dipole.

**1. On the Axial Line (End-on Position)**:

- The axial line is the line passing through both charges of the dipole.
- **General Formula**: E_axial = [k * q * 2a * (2r)] / [(r² - a²)²] (derived from vector sum of fields due to +q and -q).
- **For a Short Dipole (r >> a)**: In this common approximation, 'a' is neglected in the denominator. **E_axial = 2kp / r³**. (The negative sign often seen in derivation indicates direction relative to dipole moment).
    - **Direction**: The electric field on the axial line is always **parallel to the dipole moment (P)**.

**2. On the Equatorial Line (Broadside-on Position)**:

- The equatorial line is the line passing through the center of the dipole and perpendicular to its axis.
- **General Formula**: E_equatorial = [kp] / [(r² + a²)^(3/2)] (derived by resolving field components from +q and -q; sin components cancel, cos components add).
- **For a Short Dipole (r >> a)**: In this approximation, 'a' is neglected in the denominator. **E_equatorial = kp / r³**.
    - **Direction**: The electric field on the equatorial line is always **opposite to the dipole moment (P)**.

**3. Ratio of Axial to Equatorial Fields (for short dipole)**:

- The ratio of the magnitude of electric field on the axial line to that on the equatorial line is **2:1**. (E_axial : E_equatorial = 2kp/r³ : kp/r³ = 2:1).

**4. At Any General Point (Not typically covered in Boards, but mentioned)**:

- The electric field (E) at a point at distance r and angle θ from the dipole moment is: **E = (kp / r³) * √(1 + 3cos²θ)**.

## VI. Torque on an Electric Dipole in a Uniform Electric Field

- When an electric dipole (P) is placed in a **uniform external electric field (E)**, the positive charge (+q) experiences a force (F = qE) in the direction of E, and the negative charge (-q) experiences an equal force (F = qE) in the opposite direction of E.
- These two forces are **equal in magnitude and opposite in direction**, so the **net force on the dipole is zero**. This means the dipole will not undergo translational motion.
- However, since the forces have different lines of action, they form a **couple** and produce a **turning effect, or torque (τ)**, on the dipole.
- **Formula for Torque**:
    - **Magnitude**: **τ = pE sinθ**. Where θ is the angle between the dipole moment (P) and the electric field (E).
    - **Vector Form**: **τ = P × E**.

### A. Special Cases of Torque

1. **Minimum Torque (τ = 0)**:
    
    - Occurs when **θ = 0° or θ = 180°**.
    - In these positions, the dipole is aligned with or anti-aligned with the electric field, and the forces act along the same line of action, producing no turning effect.
    - **Equilibrium**:
        - **Stable Equilibrium**: When **θ = 0°** (dipole moment parallel to E), if slightly displaced, the dipole tends to return to this position.
        - **Unstable Equilibrium**: When **θ = 180°** (dipole moment anti-parallel to E), if slightly displaced, the dipole tends to move away from this position.
2. **Maximum Torque (τ = pE)**:
    
    - Occurs when **θ = 90°**.
    - In this position, the dipole is perpendicular to the electric field, and the forces exert the greatest turning effect.

## VII. Electric Flux and Gauss's Law

### A. Area Vector

- Traditionally, area is considered a scalar, but for electric flux calculations, **area is treated as a vector quantity**.
- **Direction**:
    - For **closed bodies** (e.g., cube, sphere), the area vector is always directed **perpendicularly outward** from the surface at every point. A sphere has infinite area vectors, while a cube has six (one for each face).
    - For **open bodies** (e.g., a flat sheet), the area vector can be chosen in either of the two perpendicular directions. The convention is to choose the direction that makes a **smaller angle with the electric field**.

### B. Electric Flux (ΦE)

- **Definition**: Electric flux is a measure of the **number of electric field lines passing perpendicularly through a given area**. It represents the total electric field passing through a surface.
- **Formula**:
    - If the electric field (E) is uniform and perpendicular to the surface area (S), flux is **ΦE = E * S**.
    - If the electric field (E) makes an angle (θ) with the area vector (S), the flux is **ΦE = E S cosθ**.
    - In vector form, it's the **dot product of the electric field vector and the area vector**: **ΦE = E ⋅ S**.
- **SI Unit**: **Newton meter squared per Coulomb (Nm²C⁻¹)**.
- **Scalar Quantity**: Electric flux is a **scalar quantity**.
- **Maximum Flux**: Occurs when θ = 0° (field lines parallel to area vector, perpendicular to surface), **ΦE = ES**.
- **Minimum Flux (Zero Flux)**: Occurs when θ = 90° (field lines perpendicular to area vector, parallel to surface), **ΦE = 0**.
- **Positive/Negative Flux**: Positive flux indicates field lines _leaving_ the surface (outgoing), and negative flux indicates field lines _entering_ the surface (incoming).

### C. Gauss's Law

Gauss's Law provides a simpler way to calculate electric flux, especially for symmetrical charge distributions.

- **Statement**: The **total electric flux (ΦE) through any closed surface is equal to the net charge (Q_enclosed) enclosed within that surface divided by the permittivity of free space (ε₀)**. **ΦE = ∫ E ⋅ dS = Q_enclosed / ε₀** (for a closed surface integral).

### D. Proof of Gauss's Law (for a point charge inside a sphere)

1. Consider a point charge 'q' at the center of a sphere of radius 'r' (Gaussian surface).
2. The electric field (E) at any point on the sphere's surface is E = kq/r², and its direction is radially outward.
3. The area vector (dS) for any small element on the sphere's surface is also radially outward.
4. Thus, the angle (θ) between E and dS is 0° at all points.
5. The total flux ΦE = ∫ E dS cos(0°) = ∫ E dS.
6. Since E is constant on the spherical surface, ΦE = E ∫ dS.
7. The integral of dS over the entire sphere is its surface area, 4πr². So, ΦE = E (4πr²).
8. Substituting E = kq/r² (where k = 1/4πε₀), we get ΦE = (1/4πε₀ * q/r²) * 4πr².
9. Simplifying, **ΦE = q / ε₀**. This proves Gauss's Law.

### E. Important Points about Gauss's Law

- **Applicable to Closed Surfaces**: Gauss's law is only applicable to **closed surfaces**. If the surface is open, an imaginary closed surface (Gaussian surface) must be constructed to apply the law.
- **Independence from Outside Charges**: The net electric flux through a closed surface **depends only on the charge _enclosed_ within it**, not on any charges outside the surface. Charges outside contribute to the electric field but do not contribute to the net flux through the surface.
- **Independence from Location**: The net flux is **independent of the location of the enclosed charge** within the Gaussian surface. Whether the charge is at the center or off-center, the total flux remains the same.
- **Independence from Shape**: The net flux is **independent of the shape of the Gaussian surface**. It can be a sphere, cube, or any irregular shape, as long as it encloses the charge.
- **Zero Net Flux**: If the total flux through a closed surface is zero, it can mean either that **no charge is enclosed** within the surface, or that **equal amounts of positive and negative charges are enclosed** (e.g., a dipole).

### F. Applications of Gauss's Law (Derivations for Electric Field)

Gauss's law is used to find the electric field for various symmetrical charge distributions.

**1. Electric Field Due to an Infinitely Long, Uniformly Charged Wire**:

- A **cylindrical Gaussian surface** is chosen around the wire.
- The electric field (E) is radial, and the area vectors for the circular ends of the cylinder are perpendicular to E (so flux through ends is zero).
- The area vector for the curved surface is parallel to E (angle 0°).
- Applying Gauss's Law (E * 2πrL = λL / ε₀), where λ is the linear charge density (charge per unit length): **E = λ / (2πε₀r)**.
- The electric field is **inversely proportional to the distance (r)** from the wire.

**2. Electric Field Due to an Infinite Plane Sheet of Charge**:

- A **cylindrical Gaussian surface** (or a rectangular prism) is chosen that passes through the sheet.
- The electric field (E) is perpendicular to the sheet, and only passes through the circular ends of the cylinder. The flux through the curved surface is zero.
- Applying Gauss's Law (E * A + E * A = σA / ε₀), where σ is the surface charge density (charge per unit area): **E = σ / (2ε₀)**.
- The electric field is **constant and independent of distance** from the sheet.

**3. Electric Field Due to a Uniformly Charged Spherical Shell (Hollow Conductor)**:

- A **spherical Gaussian surface** is chosen.
- **Outside the shell (r > R)**: The electric field is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. **E_out = kQ / r²** or **E_out = (σR²) / (ε₀r²)**.
- **On the surface of the shell (r = R)**: **E_surface = kQ / R²** or **E_surface = σ / ε₀**.
- **Inside the shell (r < R)**: Since there is no charge enclosed within a Gaussian surface inside a hollow conductor, the electric field inside is **zero**. (This is due to electrostatic shielding).

**4. Electric Field Due to a Uniformly Charged Non-Conducting Solid Sphere**:

- **Outside the sphere (r > R)**: Same as a spherical shell or point charge. **E_out = kQ / r²**.
- **On the surface of the sphere (r = R)**: Same as a spherical shell. **E_surface = kQ / R²**.
- **Inside the sphere (r < R)**: The electric field depends on the enclosed charge within the Gaussian surface of radius 'r'. **E_in = kQr / R³**. This implies that inside the solid sphere, the electric field is **directly proportional to the distance (r)** from the center.

## VIII. Graphs for Electric Field and Force

Graphical representations help visualize the variation of electric field and force.

- **Force vs. r (Coulomb's Law)**: **F ∝ 1/r²**. The graph is a curve that decreases as r increases. For F vs. 1/r², it would be a straight line.
- **Electric Field vs. r (Point Charge)**: **E ∝ 1/r²**. Similar to force, a curve decreasing as r increases.
- **Electric Field vs. r (Infinitely Long Wire)**: **E ∝ 1/r**. The graph is a curve that decreases linearly as r increases.
- **Electric Field vs. r (Infinite Plane Sheet)**: **E = constant**. The graph is a straight horizontal line, independent of r.
- **Electric Field vs. r (Spherical Shell/Hollow Conductor)**:
    - **Inside (r < R)**: E = 0 (zero).
    - **On the surface (r = R)**: E = constant (maximum).
    - **Outside (r > R)**: E ∝ 1/r² (decreases).
    - The graph is zero from the center to R, then jumps to a maximum at R, and then decreases as 1/r² outside R.
- **Electric Field vs. r (Solid Non-Conducting Sphere)**:
    - **Inside (r < R)**: E ∝ r (linear increase from center).
    - **On the surface (r = R)**: E = constant (maximum).
    - **Outside (r > R)**: E ∝ 1/r² (decreases).
    - The graph starts at zero at the center, increases linearly to a maximum at R, and then decreases as 1/r² outside R.
- **Electric Field vs. x (Charged Ring)**: The electric field is zero at the center of the ring (x=0) and increases to a maximum at x = ±R/√2, then decreases as 1/x² (for large x).

## IX. Continuous Charge Distributions

For charges distributed over a line, surface, or volume, we define charge densities:

- **Linear Charge Density (λ)**: Charge per unit length. **λ = q / L**. (Used for charged wires).
- **Surface Charge Density (σ)**: Charge per unit area. **σ = q / A**. (Used for charged sheets or surfaces of conductors).
- **Volume Charge Density (ρ)**: Charge per unit volume. **ρ = q / V**. (Used for uniformly charged solid spheres).
