### **How to Access Your Startup School Dashboard**
*(Save yourself 3 hours of troubleshooting with this quick guide)*

**The Core Issue:** You cannot log in using your standard Google account or by creating a new account. You **must** use the specific credentials provided to you.

#### **Step 1: Find the Welcome Email**
Go to your Gmail inbox and search for an email with the subject line:
> **"Welcome to Startup School"**
*(It may also mention "Prompt to Prototype")*.

#### **Step 2: Get Your Credentials**
Open that email. Inside, you will find a specific **Username (Email)** and **Password** generated for you.
*   **Action:** Copy these credentials. You will need them in a moment.

#### **Step 3: Click the Link (And Check Your Status)**
Click the **Login link** provided in that same email.

*   **⚠️ Important Warning:** If clicking the link takes you to a homepage where you are already signed in (or it looks like a generic home page), **Log Out** immediately. You need to be at a fresh Login screen.

#### **Step 4: The Login Process**
Once you are on the login page:
1.  **DO NOT** click "Sign in with Google" or any social login icons.
2.  Look for the manual text fields for **Email** and **Password**.
3.  Paste the credentials you copied from the welcome email into these fields.

#### **Step 5: Access Granted**
Click login. You should now be successfully inside your dashboard.
