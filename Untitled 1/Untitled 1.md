**Irritate (verb)**  
1. To cause annoyance, frustration, or mild anger in someone.  
2. To inflame or provoke a physical reaction in tissue, leading to discomfort or inflammation.  

*Example:* “The constant noise began to irritate her, and the rash on her arm started to irritate, becoming red and sore.”

**Iterate** (verb)

1. **General meaning**: To repeat a process or action, often with the goal of approaching a desired result or improving upon a previous version.
2. **In mathematics**: To apply a function repeatedly to its own output. For example, iterating the function f(x) = x + 1 starting from 0 yields the sequence 0, 1, 2, 3, …
3. **In computer programming**: To loop over elements of a collection (such as an array, list, or set) one by one. Common constructs include `for` loops, `while` loops, and iterator objects.
4. **In product development**: To create successive versions of a product, each incorporating feedback or enhancements from the previous version.

**Example usage**:  
- “We need to **iterate** on the prototype until the performance meets the specifications.”  
- “The algorithm **iterates** over each node in the graph to compute the shortest path.”
