> [!SUCCESS] Yes, absolutely! A matrix can be a **Zero Matrix** and a **Square Matrix** at the same time.

Let's quickly recall the definitions to see why:

1.  **Zero Matrix (or Null Matrix):**
> [!DEFINITION]
    > A matrix is called a **zero matrix** if *all its elements are zero*.
    > It is denoted by $O$ or $0$. Its order can be any $m \times n$.
    >
    > **Examples:**
    > *   $O_{2 \times 3} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ (a $2 \times 3$ zero matrix)
    > *   $O_{1 \times 1} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \end{bmatrix}$ (a $1 \times 1$ zero matrix)

2.  **Square Matrix:**
> [!DEFINITION]
    > A matrix is called a **square matrix** if the *number of rows is equal to the number of columns*.
    > Its order is $m \times m$ (or simply referred to as "order m").
    >
    > **Examples:**
    > *   $A_{2 \times 2} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}$ (a $2 \times 2$ square matrix)
    > *   $B_{3 \times 3} = \begin{bmatrix} 5 & 6 & 7 \\ 8 & 9 & 0 \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \end{bmatrix}$ (a $3 \times 3$ square matrix)

### Combining the Definitions:

For a matrix to be *both* a Zero Matrix AND a Square Matrix, it must satisfy both conditions:

1.  All its elements must be zero.
2.  Its number of rows must equal its number of columns.

This is perfectly possible!

> [!EXAMPLE] Zero Square Matrices
> Here are examples of matrices that are both zero matrices and square matrices:
>
> *   **$O_{1 \times 1} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \end{bmatrix}$**
>     *   All elements are zero.
>     *   Number of rows (1) = Number of columns (1).
> *   **$O_{2 \times 2} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$**
>     *   All elements are zero.
>     *   Number of rows (2) = Number of columns (2).
> *   **$O_{3 \times 3} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$**
>     *   All elements are zero.
>     *   Number of rows (3) = Number of columns (3).

> [!CONCLUSION]
> So, yes, a matrix can absolutely be both a **zero matrix** and a **square matrix** simultaneously. This happens when it's a square matrix where every single entry is zero.

This is an important distinction because the zero matrix acts as the additive identity, and when it's also square, it has properties relevant to square matrix operations like multiplication.
